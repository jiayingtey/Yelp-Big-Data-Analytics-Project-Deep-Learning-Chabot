PS our total was ~80 without tip.\n\nBoyfriend's opinion: The date bacon was a good mix of sweet and salty, texture was different, but the date was a little strong. Tartare was good, fresh, yolk was a good touch. The duck was rich but a little oily. Potato bravas was good aioli was nice, good crispiness. Octopus had good texture, but sauce could've been better.

I got the large lemon green tea and it was just ok, my only complaint being too much lemon inside and not enough to actually drink. As for the negatives: This place needs more comfortable seating!! There's barely any tables despite how large this place is. Most of it is empty space and during times where it is too crowded, this is largely inconvenient for customers.

Then I asked her a question, but she was already exchanging pleasenties with a yoga instructor and ignored me. After that she immediately tended to another customer. I said \"\"excuse me\"\" and repeared my Yes-or-No question, she said \"\"I'll be right with you\"\" and kept talking to the customer. I had to walk away, because I didn't want to be late for class. She never answered my question.\nThe studio is small and there is clearly not enough space for people to store their clothes.\nThe classes are scheduled back to back, so people have to line up and wait for the previous class to clear out. In other studios you can place your mat at least 15min before the class, stretch, calm down after work..\nThere was so little space between the mats yet people kept saying how much room there was. I wonder why we pay so much money to put up with all this? Yyoga should decrease the limit of people in such small room, which will immediately force them to get bigger studios.\nOH and my favourite - glass walls between showers and toilets. You can see a lot. Especially the shared wall between shower and toilet stall - who designed this?\nI think after a long day of work people go to yoga to relieve the stress, and not to get attitude from a receptionist.

It was good but I felt the pork wasn't hitting the spot for me. \n\nThe total was around $25 and some change and that was with no drinks, besides water. \n\nNice first visit.

So by this time its 9:50  were still waiting on our table, I go to ask how much longer , the hostess says we have 2 more ppl ahead of us with an attitude and says there have been ppl waiting for over an hour and we cant just make ppl get up and leave..so rudely! So finally at 10:15pm we get seated as they were still arranging the tables when we were walking to our table where we had to stand for a few mins till they finish. We finally ordered and were told they were out of ribs which my husband wanted.. so we both ordered filet mignon, I ask the waiter twice please make sure that our steaks are well done he said no problem. So while waiting for our food we hear commotion and there was a fight that broke out at the bar with some women... another red flag I was definitely ready to go at this point, but hubby was like he wanted to stay cause he was so hungry so I agreed to stay. Our food finally came out at 11pm and it was still really red in the middle when i asked twice for well done so at this point I said enough.. we informed the waiter we didnt want it and just give us the bill for our drinks...the manager came over trying to plead with us but it was a no for me....

Problem #2 they have a \"\"vip\"\" area which people rent out but the only thing saying it's the vip area is a small sign which we completely missed as it it was our first time there so we enter since it looked pretty cool and we are immediately thrown out of the area with an EXTREMELY RUDE ATTITUDE.

This place is definitely for a younger crowd who doesn't mind cramped seating, bad parking options, and a loud atmosphere. Coming here with friends is a great time, coming here with your parents is not. Regardless of which location you pick you can expect to drive around searching for parking and waiting to be seated unless you go during the off times. When I came to the Clintonville location I found it particularly hard to find parking because of where it's located in the strip. I highly recommend walking or using ride share to get there so you don't have to worry about the parking situation. In addition, I wouldn't say Condado's is a great place if you're looking for something that's handicap accessible. It is pretty tricky to maneuver in the restaurant since there are so many people and tables are fairly close together, but I'm sure if you mention it they would try to seat you closer to the front! \n\nWith that being said Condado's is an awesome place to come for tacos, margs on the rocks, and plenty of chips and dip (not free, you do have to pay!)! When I come here I love to build my own tacos and always opt for the Sweet Lucy shell (flour tortilla, corn tortilla, queso and guac layered together) as a base for my creations. I'm a huge fan of the braised beef brisket as well as the pulled pork for the filling, but also enjoy some of their excellent vegetarian options such as the Thai chili tofu. To change things up pair the brisket with the pineapple salsa, queso fresco, and the chipotle honey sauce! Yum. If you're not feeling creative they've got you covered with a set menu of tacos you can order from. I will also say the tacos are fairly large. If you're ordering chips and dip I suggest only getting 2 tacos as you'll fill up quicker than expected. \n\nAll in all once you make it inside it's a nice relaxing joint to chill out with some friends and enjoy some delicious food. If you're visiting Columbus a stop at one of the Condado Tacos locations should make your itinerary.\"",0,"2019-01-01"],["ocGlGgaJxlK-4OFtY9DDgw",0,"2019-01-01T18:57:47.000Z",0,1,1.0,"Truly discrimination at it's finest.

I wanted to try all the things and figured they'd make good leftovers, so I got the pate trio, the eggplant walnut-pate roll-up dealies, the smoked-bean stuffed-dough doohickey, the mushroom dumpling jobbers, and a side of the red pepper stuff (I don't recall the proper names of anything, sry). \n\nThe beet pate legit tasted moldy (don't ask me how I know what mold tastes like..?), the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on, and the spinach pate would've been good if it wasn't so salty. The eggplant walnut-pate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own.. it was basically just a mouthful of pate. The smoked-bean dough thing was SOooooooo effing salty.. and I'm not one to shy away from salt. I couldn't even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt, but it def could've used the extra flavor otherwise. The mushroom dumplings looked so good, and I LOVE all things mushroom (and dumpling!), but these were all mushroom and nothing else.. the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with. These just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a Friday night cuz they weren't invited to the onion and herb party at the Savory's.. They even got all dolled up in their dough dress and put on their best cracked pepper.. It was a pretty sad day in dumpling town..\n\nAll in all, my experience was pretty shMEHhhhh. I'd avoid this place if you're vegan or dairy-free. Im sure that puddle of cheesy eggy butter bread is orgasmic, and maybe the meat dishes are worth eating, but everything I ordered was really disappointing.. Although, the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty. Heavy on the fenugreek tho, which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it. The pita-like bread that came with the pate trio was good too, so if I eat there again (unlikely) I'll get the bread with a side of fenugreek-sweat surprise, and maybe I'll try the meat dumplings.. \n\nHopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they don't make any more super salty or moldy-tasting mistakes!\"",1,"2019-01-01"],["eY3-ZE8-njGOglACqFYqVQ",0,"2019-01-11T20:38:46.000Z",0,1,5.0,"LaBottega is our family's favorite restaurant in Vancouver!

Unfortunately those days are long gone.  We did a pickup of 2 medium pizzas ($11 total), great low price, however still not worth it.  I think it is pretty sad that I would expect their buffet pizza to be better quality, not sure if any locations still do that.\n\nAs for the experience.  I ordered through the app, easy enough.  When i arrived I came inside to this store which is pretty small.  There was a couple dining inside, but as I approached the counter I didn't see a worker at all.  I continued to stand there for 5-10 minutes and I didn't hear a peep.  I could see cooked pizzas at the end of the conveyor belt, but no action otherwise.

I was sticking to vegetarian options that night and ordered the Tsel Phaley and the vegetarian momos. \n\nThe Tsel Phaley was very interesting. It was basically vegetables and noodles rolled into a spongey-wrap (could almost equate it to an uthappam for anyone familiar with South Indian cuisine). I liked it, but it was pretty oily. This dish is definitely on the smaller side, more of an appetizer.\n\nThe vegetarian momos were pretty bland. Luckily, they had given us a few sauces and pickled vegetables which we were able to use to add a little more flavor. Would avoid getting these again. \n\nOther folks got the Sha Phaley (bread stuffed with beef), beef momos, and eggplant, which were all acceptable.\n\nWe also ordered one Tibetan tea, since some people had never tried it before. It came in a really adorable mug and was a lot less buttery than other Tibetan teas I have had, which I appreciated.\n\nOur waitress and servers were incredibly friendly. They were very accommodating when we asked if we could cut a cake we had brought to the restaurant separately. Also, we were all having such a nice time catching up that we ended up staying until closing (10 PM) and they never rushed us out or made it seem like we were inconveniencing them.\n\nOverall, was expecting more from the food but not a bad option for a casual meal with friends.\"",1,"2019-01-01"],["sZA0keiME0I0IXSh_zPZGw",0,"2019-02-14T22:32:01.000Z",0,2,5.0,"I've been coming here for at least 12 years.

Thankfully, I don't like the taste of alcohol so the sangria served as just an awesome beverage that went well with my food.\nWill I return here? Absolutely.

I spoke with Ed when I arrived to VIP and he took a look at my car and we made an arrangement for me to come in several days later so that the mechanic could go under the headliner and check the antenna for damage and try to resecure the antenna.

Once we were seated I took off my grey wrap around sweater and place it on the seat next to me. Unfortunately we left without my sweater. I called the restaurant later that day and was told they did not have it. I was advised to call back in a    couple of days which I did. Again I was told they did not have it. I tried again a week later and was told the same thing. No sweater. We dined at Hollerbach's again 6 months later and of course I asked about my sweater only to be told they did not have it. So today we decided to make the 90 minute trip to Sanford and visit our favorite German restaurant and upon our arrival (approximately 2:00 PM) both our jaws hit the floor. The hostess who was stationed outside was WEARING MY SWEATER. I immediately told her I liked her sweater and asked her where she got it. She appeared to be shocked so I told her that I had the same sweater and that I had left it behind at this very restaurant. She responded by telling me she got it at Target. This sweater was purchased at Dillard's in Ocala, FL and was not a Target product. In addition to that, this young lady was swimming in this sweater which was a size 3X. I did ask our waiter about the lost and found policy being that he was fairly new, he was unsure. He did offer to get a manager, however, we declined since it's just going to be her word against mine.

It looks like the most recent really negative Yelp reviews are from 08/2018. I can't speak to what those negative reviewers received, but my experience at this location has always been really positive (I live really closeby, so I periodically pop in to buy random treats for my dogs). \n\nToday was my first time though taking my two medium-sized dogs here for nail buffing (i.e. ground instead of cut). I actually went twice today because I took my dogs separately. Both experiences were absolutely positive. The groomer Brittany was soooooo awesome! One of my dogs has been orthopaedically-challenged since he was a puppy (he's now 12+-years old) and has never been able to walk a lot, which unfortunately means it's hard to wear his nails down naturally (i.e. his quiks are pretty long). Plus, he has all black nails. Despite that, Brittany still managed to give him a really nice pedicure! I literally cannot recall the last time his nails have looked this great (he's been in our family for 12 years...). Previously, I always took him to his vet or doggy daycare's grooming for his nail trims, but they never managed to give him such nice pedicures. Brittany is AMAZING! Brittany gave my other dog a lovely pedicure as well. \n\nMarcus at the register was also super awesome, helpful, and friendly =)\n\nPlease don't be dissuaded by the negative Yelp ratings for this store - the store may have been less-than-pleasant in the past, but I can wholeheartedly say that my experience here as been quite positive! Please give them a shot (and give positive Yelp reviews if you're inclined) so that they stay in our Buckhead neighborhood.

If you value your time and money, however...stay away!  I went here today to return an item my partner purchased a few days before.  I explained that I did not have the receipt but I did have the card it was paid with as well as a bank statement with the purchase information.  The item was a battery and I explained that the item was either not working properly or I wasn't using it properly and would like to return it.  All parts were in new condition.  Unfortunately, I ran into the return gestapo in the form of two male employees.  One employee began questioning me about the item and whether or not I had purchased it at that location, did I charge it, etc.  He said it looked like I hadn't even taken it out of the box.  I looked around for a sign with the return policy and there wasn't one, so I was confused about why they were asking so many questions.  The other male whispered something in his ear, which I thought to be very unprofessional.  Don't whisper something in front of a customer.  After the interrogation, the man stated that he could give me a store credit for the item and proceeded to walk away.  He then came back and stated that he couldn't give me a store credit and he didn't even think they carried the item.  So, I asked him if they did carry it.  He made it seem as though I had either stolen the item and wanted to return it or I had purchased from another store and was trying to return there.  The store manager then came out and stated that they do not do returns for that particular item.  He proceeded to look up the item in the computer and sure enough it was bought there 5 days prior.  He claims he told my partner there were no returns.  However, if the item is defective, they need to take it back.  Instead of testing the item or taking the time to explain how it works-maybe I was using it wrong- they told me to call the manufacturer for a refund.  Excuse me, but if I buy an item from that store and it is not working properly, it needs to be returned at that store.  I didn't buy it from the manufacturer, I bought it there!  Also, at one point the rude male employee actually laughed at me and stated that the reason it wasn't working is because I hadn't charged it.  Since he did not test it for himself, I'm confused about how he came to that conclusion.

The vegan options are plentiful, with things like spring rolls, noodle bowls, sautéed vegetables (like I can EVER resist bok choy?!) I think my eyes teared a bit looking at the menu, I swear. This is pretty much my favorite food on the planet.\n\nIt was a Friday night and people eat out on Friday nights, especially at 5 star places. The nicest lady at the host stand took my name and promised to text when a table was ready. And pay attention, because this is something that put this place over the top in the list of Joi B's favorite restaurants in the US (yes, Meyers & Chang, you're on it): when our table was ready 45 minutes later, we were at a cute pub right across the street, not minding a thing. The text informed us that our counter seats were ready. When I'm not dining alone, the last place in the world I want to sit is at a counter. Hell, even if I had been eating alone, I would have done so begrudgingly (and only if really hungry). So, I texted back and asked if it was OK if we waited a little longer for a table. The response was nothing short of wonderful. \"\"Sure, we can do that! It should be another half hour...\"\" Wow! I'm so used to high demand places acting like they are doing you a huge favor to seat you where you want (or NOT seat you where you don't want).

And an extremely pleasing flavor) and crispy spring rolls that I devoured so quickly, they were barely even there. What I loved about these is all that swiss chard complicating things and making them better. Loved. Loved. Loved. It all.\n\nAnd they have cocktails (next time I have to try the homemade pineapple vodka), two of which feature mezcal, so hello. And a very decent Cava by the glass. Did I mention celebratory?

I didn't even get to finish it all because it was just too much. But damn was it nice. I think it could've been a bit more tender and juicy, but for the portion size it was still damn good, especially with their sauces on the table which I thought were fantastic.

I also enjoy the Mother Earth bowl and Thai Dye wrap.  The Mother Earth bowl comes with avocado, sweet potatoes, charred onions, arugula, as well as a protein of your choice.  If you're hungry, order the shaved beef but I usually order the salmon.  The Thai Dye wrap is a tofu wrap with moderately spicy sauce inside.  It's a small portion so this isn't a good bet if you're very hungry.  I love Flower Child and usually end up here with a girlfriend but even my husband will ask to eat here.",1,"2019-01-01"],["UxHdOAW-7pjH0NWdoUcf3g",0,"2019-03-02T05:04:17.000Z",0,3,1.0,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would.

And since I knew my boyfriend was a concert goer I thought this would be a great way to start off the holidays. \n\nMy boyfriend has been to this location on several occasions, but as for me this was my first visit. Therefore, I trusted him with the navigation and parking. And to my luck, I made a great decision.  He knows the area pretty well, so we found parking in a jiffy. From our parking space to the venue we only had to walk approximately two blocks. Pretty good especially for the price we paid. \n\nAs we walked up to the building we fell in line with other concerts goers. The staff of the tabernacle did a fairly decent job organizing patrons in the outside line. They checked our bags at one checkpoint, then they wanded our bodies in the next checkpoint, and at the last checkpoint they checked for tickets. Pretty seamless and easy. \n\nAs we walked in I realized that this is the building I've walked/drove past on numerous occasions. The building looks to be an old place of worship. My thoughts on converting a place of worship to a concert venue are still undecided; however I believe the owners did an amazing job maintaining the integrity of the building. There approximately four levels to the building (I could be wrong but that's all I saw). If you walk straight in and downstairs to the basement floor you are greeted by two large bars on either side of the room. There is space for sitting, space to lean on table, places to drink, and even snagging a picture in the photo booth. The drinks and food are obviously overpriced, as any other venue or theme park would be. So don't be upset when you get hit with the bill. As you walk back up the stairs you notice the beauty of the architecture. The stairs are well preserved and so are the stained glass windows. The main floor is the concert area where you see a backdrop of an organ, that has to be decades old if I have to guess. Then above the empty space/standing room there is seating room on two additional levels.\n\nOverall I believe this concert venue deserves an A-. It is very spacious, the owners have maintained the integrity of the building, and I appreciate the multiple seats and spaces for people. Whether you like to stand and jump about of sit and sip this is pretty awesome. Pitfalls, the drinks and food are over priced and parking is hard to come by, unless you would like to pay about $15+ for parking.\"",1,"2019-01-01"],["5iasxw7Rl-BoVuueD9kOyA",0,"2019-01-04T21:42:43.000Z",0,1,1.0,"This is the worst experience I have ever had with any type of utility company.

Not a lot of tables so I'm sure it can get pretty busy. The vibe of the place is very comfortable and casual. \n\nSERVICE\nIt was not busy (plenty of empty tables) but it took our waitress 10-15 to finally approach our table. At the end the hostess cleared our dessert plates and our waitress again didn't approach us for about 15-20 minutes. In between the food seemed to come out very slowly with the exception of our entrees. \n\nFOOD / BEVERAGE\nThis was really where the meal fell short for us. For appetizers we tried their tomato bisque and the brie plate. The tomato bisque was OK but not what I would typically expect from a bisque. The brie plate was WAY too sweet. It really needed something salty, savory, or spicy to balance out ALL the sweet things on the plate -- apples, strawberries, marmalade, honey. For the entree we got the sesame orange glazed salmon and the chicken saltimbocca. The salmon on its own was good, as was the broccolini that came with it, but the sauce was WAY too salty and the rice was under-seasoned. The chicken had a weird quality that made it look reheated which was not appealing. It lacked flavor and the sauce was not particularly great. The au gratin potatoes were a crowd favorite. For dessert we both got the apple crisp and it was truly the highlight of the meal. Absolutely perfect. \n\nRESTROOMS\nCute single stall restroom. They offer mouthwash which was a nice perk. \n\nDue to our experience I don't think we will be returning, but if you go definitely try the apple crisp.\"",1,"2019-01-01"],["0Dd1Cjt_XoVaEvPOkyBD-g",2,"2019-02-20T00:30:51.000Z",0,2,5.0,"\"**Update 2/19/2019**\n\nI still love this park! And, living nearby, I walk my dog here at least three times each day. I was recently checking out my past reviews and noticed this one and I realized I neglected to mention a few points about this park:\n-unlike most other dog parks (okay, unlike ALL other dog parks, really), this one is unfenced. So if your dog is not well socialized (like mine), or doesn't obey commands or isn't well trained (like mine), or if you're afraid he/she might run away if he/she sees a squirrel or a low-lying crow or God-knows-what (like mine), you'd best be advised to keep your dog on a leash at this park. I do. \n-there's a free-standing post in the park containing free doggie waste bags, if you forgot to bring some. Nice! PLEASE remember to pick up after your dog! \n-there are two stone sculptural reclining animals (a tiger and a lion, I think) at the north side of the park, closer to the Cambie Bridge, and these sculptures are actually water fountains for dogs (!). In the warmer months, metal dog bowls are placed under the sculptures' mouths and there's a button to push that will fill these bowls with water, so Fido can have a drink. Nice! \n-there's a super nice playground area for toddlers and kids hidden between two condo buildings to the east in the park, with a lot of benches nearby. This playground area is open to the public and has modern, modular pieces. (This playground is separate from the one directly under the Cambie Bridge, just a few steps away, literally).

I've heard many great things about this place and its chicken and thought it'd be a great place to catch up with old friends.\n\nWe came in yesterday around 6:30p or so, about an hour after opening. It looked like a slow night and we were seated promptly. We were given water and silverware while we were waiting on another person. Things were looking good for this establishment so far.\nWhen the last member of our party arrived we were ready to order. One of my friends ordered 5 drumsticks. The waitress told us to hold on a second and hurried away. She came back to say they were out of drumsticks but had exactly 5 left for my friend. That was interesting... We continued ordering.\nOne of my friends ordered 5 chicken tenders with sauce on the side and no fries. Another friend ordered a pint of Bluemoon and some dumplings. My other friend ordered the kimchi fries with just regular cut fries.\nI wanted to order the drumsticks, but since they suddenly ran out, I tried to order the wings. The waitress told me they ran out of wings without checking, so I settled for the tenders and a side of waffle fries. I felt a little disappointed since I was eager to try their drumsticks, not the tenders.\nOur food came out and there were mix ups. I didn't get my side of fries and my other friend who ordered the tenders got the fries instead. My friend who ordered the kimchi fries with regular cut fries received waffle fries. It was probably just a simple mistake. We didn't call the waitress over and just made do. It wasn't too big of a deal.\nThe food was good. I tried my friend's drumstick and it was great. The chicken tenders paled in comparison. They were decent, but they weren't anything special like the drumstick. The fries were crispy and satisfying. My friends enjoyed their food. But this is where the dining experience went downhill.\nWe asked for 5 separate checks. The waitress said sure, but came back after a few minutes. She said they were only allowed to split checks 4 ways, but that she was willing to split it 5 ways. We thanked her for being kind enough to do that and she walked away. However, when she came back the checks were very messed up.\nMy friend was charged for the fries he never ordered, my bill only charged me only for the tenders and not the fries, but my friend who ordered the dumplings and pint of beer was charged with an entree of chicken tenders that she never ordered.\nThe latter of the charges was alarming, so we called the waitress over. After much explaining, she finally took the charge for the entree of chicken tenders off. We paid, tipped, and were on our way.\n\nOverall, the experience was not great. I didn't understand how they could be out of drumsticks and wings after being open for an hour or so. It didn't make sense. It was a slow night. There were two, maybe three, other groups. For a place that's open until 1-2am, you would think they'd have enough chicken.....\nThe mix up with the food wasn't great, but tolerable. Mistakes happen. My friends and I were okay with it, but it dampened the experience.\n\nThe food was good. The drumsticks and fries tasted great, but the tenders were just decent. My friends and I enjoyed the food we received.\n\nHowever, the check mix up was just awful. How did my friend get charged for an entree she never ordered? Those mystery chicken tenders never made it to the table, but they certainly found their way onto my friend's bill.\n\nIn short, the food was pretty okay but the experience certainly left much to be desired. I'm not sure if the quality of food is worth the poor service. I don't know if I would consider coming back to this establishment after this first experience.\"",1,"2019-01-01"],["CDwUv7RiWSbRSLhpGZV2cQ",0,"2019-03-04T15:12:46.000Z",0,3,3.0,"\"Pros: Very cool, modern hotel.

What are we supposed to do when we sleep? Front desk person, named Katie, said she would be more than happy to have a fan sent to the rooms and a portable heater. Really?!?! We are spending almost $8000 for the weekend and we have to open windows and have portable fans in the rooms?!?!\n\n2. All dining in the hotel is closed due to construction. They offer a continental breakfast for $25. Bagels and juice for $25!?!? Again, at the price point of this hotel, this is ridiculous.\n\n3. Water pressure in the shower is non-existent. Water comes out of the shower head like a slow water fall in a small creek. \n\nI gave this place two stars because the service is pretty good. It's not the employees fault that the hotel is not worth staying at. When the product is bad, it's bad.\"",1,"2019-01-01"],["BgkYVRvFBVnXhTeYgmXg_Q",0,"2019-01-23T21:12:13.000Z",0,1,5.0,"So the pounds had crept on over the last couple of years and some colleagues were seeing good results with Profiles - I decided to give it a whirl.

My feedback is to listen intently in the first few sessions and write down everything you are eating - they can then help you trouble shoot, etc if you are not losing.

I can't measure the value against how long you'd wait in line as I went on a Wednesday evening with a short line. If I were to guess though, it's worth going if the wait is under an hour.\n\nIt's good to have a top BBQ spot in Austin open for dinner. Though it may not be on the level of Franklin's or la Barbecue, Terry Black's Barbecue is a premiere BBQ experience especially for a large place open for dinner. \n\nMeats:\nReally like the Brisket and Jalapeño cheese sausage.\nBeef ribs were a little dry despite having too much hardened fat layers. I did not try the pork ribs.\nAs others said, the brisket is salty so grab some complimentary white bread by the utensils area, which also offers free pickle slices and limes. Get a Jalapeño pepper or 2 for 35 cents each. \n\nSides: Cole slaw was ok. Cornbread is excellent. Huge muffins that are soft and not too dry. \n\nDessert: Banana Pudding has a few chunks of banana. It was ok.\n\nOverall, it's a very fun place to grab dinner. Go with a group, grab some beer or wine from the iced station while you're in line with your tray. Everyone's incredibly friendly. Nice to have unlimited white bread and pickles.\n\nYou can get smaller portions so instead of ordering a whole pound of sausage you can just order a link.\n\nCall them to get expected line-wait time and what meat is still available. \n\n4.5 stars so I'll round up to 5.\"",0,"2019-01-01"],["_0jwczJo5LaSo8e6liyS4Q",3,"2019-01-14T17:47:11.000Z",2,1,3.0,"Coffee shop within the Atlanta History Center.

It ended to be rather salty and leave you quite thirsty. \n\nI will return, but perhaps the other location as some friends have commented that their ramen are different.\"",0,"2019-01-01"],["nqKL5PbJbwwoCK_Xon31kA",0,"2019-02-16T15:51:03.000Z",0,2,5.0,"Absolutely amazing food and service.

The goat cheese salad was delicious, lightly dressed just how I like it! The noodle bowl was okay, hardly any meat and very salty.

They had some really interesting flavours that most other ice-cream cafes don't have. I love how they offer ice-cream flights; 4 scoops for $12. That's what really intrigued me to come here, since I always have the hardest time choosing a flavour. The 4 flavours I chose were: HK Milk Tea, Raspberry White Chocolate Rose, Lychee Osmanthus and Viet Coffee.\n\nHK Milk Tea: 2/5 - I was really excited to try this flavour only to be disappointed. Probably because I'm used to more sweet milk teas, this had more of a tea taste. \n\nRaspberry White Chocolate Rose: 4/5 - I really enjoyed this flavour. I'm already a fan of Raspberry White Chocolate ice-cream but that added flavour of rose just made it even better! It was a settle rose taste the lingers after your take a bite, not too over powering. \n\nLychee Osmanthus: 5/5 - Now this flavour I loved!!!! It had a fruity and floral vibe to it which went really well together. Sometimes I find lychee flavoured things too sweet but I think the osmanthus helped cut that a bit and balanced it out really well. It has a very light flavour, it was really good. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try. \n\nViet Coffee: 3/5 - I'm not a big fan of coffee flavoured stuff but this one wasn't bad. It wasn't too bitter or too sweet. I liked how the coffee flavour wasn't too in your face.

The kind cashier informed me that they do not currently have an online ordering option but to check back later this year. He informed me that each wrap takes about 3-4 minutes per person and my best guess would be to count the number ahead of me and add that up. There wasn't any safe parking available. I left to check on my car. The neighborhood is safe but I had to park in front of someone's home. (My fault and my choice). The cashier was patient, a bit condescending but that is understandable.

Never been here before so we were trying to figure out what to order and the waitress didn't give us any suggestions. When our orders were finally in, we got our food at very different times. I asked for fried dumplings and only the bottom portion was actually fried. I've been to other restaurants where they fry the whole thing so I was pretty thrown off by that, but that was okay. The waitress never came over to ask how everything was. Never refilled our water. Just put the food down wherever without making sure it was for the right person. So overall, we decided not to tip for a service where they literally put the food down and walked away. As we were leaving, the waitress comes after us saying \"\"no tip?\"\" and we respond \"\"no\"\". She didn't ask why or what she could do to improve and immediately went to get the manager. Now I don't know his name, but he was so rude. First it seemed like he was trying to understand why, but overall he was just trying to get us to pay a tip which the waitress did not deserve. Everything was explained to him and then he starts saying \"\"oh they shouldn't clean the tables or refill the water or take your orders\"\". This was just out right rude. Honestly I could have placed an order and picked it up from the kitchen myself and it would have been the same service. Then the manager comes outside after we finally leave and tried to continue to have the conversation with us. That's just out right harassment.

We had made reservations and got seated immediately which was nice. The restaurant wasn't all that busy- then again, it was a Tuesday night. We sat down and a few people ordered the $5 mule. The waitress said they had run out of strawberry and passion fruit, so one friend ordered lime, and the other ordered cucumber. The waitress brought back 2 lime drinks. She corrected it once she found out. I ordered a clam chowder soup (it's described as being very popular at this restaurant) and a quinoa and avocado Powerbowl. My friend ordered a steak well done. My other friends ordered various things. I expected my soup to get to me before my food did, but I sat there in 45 minutes to an hour of hungry misery, and all my friends started getting antsy for their own food. I was about to tell the waitress to forget about the soup when she finally brought all the food to us. She told me she'd get me a spoon and be right back, but as I ate my powerbowl, I realized she must have forgotten, because 15 minutes went by with no spoon. Well I wasn't going to let my soup go cold, so I drank it like the orphan in Oliver Twist. The soup itself was very delicious, and I can see why it's popular. To quote Oliver Twist, \"\"Please sir, I want some more.\"\"\nHowever, the avocado and quinoa powerbowl was a bit disappointing. The dressing was nowhere to be found when you first look at it- I finally saw it at the bottom of the dish in small clumps on one side of the plate. My friend's steak was definitely not well done (more like medium). When he sent it back to be cooked more, he had to wait so long we were all done with our meals. He asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said well done steaks take longer than less cooked steaks. Well yes, obviously, except we just expected the chef to cook that same steak more thoroughly. I guess they had to heat up a whole new steak???\nEither way, my friends argued that they wanted the steak comped for the inconvenience, and then pointed out my missing spoon. The waitress sheepishly apologized. I feel her pain- I used to be a waitress. I understand the frustrations of forgetting something simple or being blamed for the steak that the kitchen can't seem to cook well. Girl, I know how you feel. \nNevertheless, I wouldn't go back here except maybe to try the brunch.

I love the option to sit at the bar if you've got a small party (1-2) where it's first come first serve. It's our go-to spot when we're craving Japanese beer, which they have on tap! My favorite is the spicy chicken ramen, which I get at the spiciest level - good heat, nice veggies, some umami flavor, thin noodles. We've had a number of the appetizers here as well, standouts being the brussel sprouts and crispy chicken. They've also got great combos, where you can add on things like crispy chicken + salad to a ramen order, which my fiance and I will often split as some food to go with our beers. \n\nMy only real complaint is the service, which leaves something to be desired. We'll often have to ask for things twice, or go hunt down waiters to ask for more water, napkins, etc. Once, we ordered drinks, and only got it after we waited 20 minutes for our food. They also haven't been the friendliest staff we've experienced, though I get the feeling that a lot of times they're just feeling slammed/overwhelmed by the high volume of customers. Still, we've had very pleasant experiences at other crowded restaurants, so I don't think it's unreasonable to want a friendlier/more helpful staff here.\n\nOverall, the food and the beer/hot sake on tap makes this worthwhile to go to.

The pulpo was cooked very tenderly which my boyfriend liked, but I like my octopus a little chewier. The chocolate for the churros could've been a little thicker. My boyfriend thought the churros could've been smaller in thicker because he thought it should be crispier. Overall, good food :). PS our total was ~80 without tip.\n\nBoyfriend's opinion: The date bacon was a good mix of sweet and salty, texture was different, but the date was a little strong. Tartare was good, fresh, yolk was a good touch. The duck was rich but a little oily. Potato bravas was good aioli was nice, good crispiness. Octopus had good texture, but sauce could've been better. And the churros were ok, choco sauce couldve been better. Beet salad was good, strong flavors, the cheese clashed with it a bit.

I was all excited for the yoga class, but barely remembered where everything was. \nDuring the check in the receptionist butchered my name, and when I corrected her didn't even say sorry. Then I asked her a question, but she was already exchanging pleasenties with a yoga instructor and ignored me. After that she immediately tended to another customer. I said \"\"excuse me\"\" and repeared my Yes-or-No question, she said \"\"I'll be right with you\"\" and kept talking to the customer. I had to walk away, because I didn't want to be late for class. She never answered my question.\nThe studio is small and there is clearly not enough space for people to store their clothes.\nThe classes are scheduled back to back, so people have to line up and wait for the previous class to clear out. In other studios you can place your mat at least 15min before the class, stretch, calm down after work..\nThere was so little space between the mats yet people kept saying how much room there was. I wonder why we pay so much money to put up with all this? Yyoga should decrease the limit of people in such small room, which will immediately force them to get bigger studios.\nOH and my favourite - glass walls between showers and toilets. You can see a lot. Especially the shared wall between shower and toilet stall - who designed this?\nI think after a long day of work people go to yoga to relieve the stress, and not to get attitude from a receptionist.

I'm sure she would have found anything we requested to make us happy. \n  The pizza was great! We had the vegan veggie slice and a pepperoni and mushroom. The pepperoni was greasy but that's the nature of the beast, true to the New York style! Overall the pricing is a good value for great food. The environment was clean and eclectic.

It was quiet when the lady and I stopped by. (Saturday around 5ish) so I enjoyed that. \n\nYou order before you sit. (You can sit down first if you'd like, but you won't get food lol)\n\nWe ordered 4 sliders and some fries (comes with a lot) to share. The sellwood, the morrison, the broadway and another one that I don't see on the menu. Might have been a special? It was more of a sandwich and not a burger/chicken burger. Regardless, it was our least favorite lol. \n\nThe other 3 were tasty! I think our favorite was the sellwood. It is a solid slider and I want to come back to try it in regular form. The Morrison was very similar to the sellwood, just with chicken so that was good too. The peppers on the Broadway is what made that slider come together. It was good but I felt the pork wasn't hitting the spot for me. \n\nThe total was around $25 and some change and that was with no drinks, besides water. \n\nNice first visit.

A little salty on the chips this time but maybe because it was a hot day and I needed some water after being in the theme park playing.

We had reservations for 9pm and arrived with 5 mins to spare only to be told there was a 30 min wait still!! Okay cool no problem we found seats at the bar, but then another red flag we could'nt get service. It took someone 20 mins to finally ask if we needed anything as we tried to get the many employees attention that kept walking behind the bar... we could'nt tell who was a bartender and who was not! So by this time its 9:50  were still waiting on our table, I go to ask how much longer , the hostess says we have 2 more ppl ahead of us with an attitude and says there have been ppl waiting for over an hour and we cant just make ppl get up and leave..so rudely! So finally at 10:15pm we get seated as they were still arranging the tables when we were walking to our table where we had to stand for a few mins till they finish. We finally ordered and were told they were out of ribs which my husband wanted.. so we both ordered filet mignon, I ask the waiter twice please make sure that our steaks are well done he said no problem. So while waiting for our food we hear commotion and there was a fight that broke out at the bar with some women... another red flag I was definitely ready to go at this point, but hubby was like he wanted to stay cause he was so hungry so I agreed to stay. Our food finally came out at 11pm and it was still really red in the middle when i asked twice for well done so at this point I said enough.. we informed the waiter we didnt want it and just give us the bill for our drinks...the manager came over trying to plead with us but it was a no for me....

There is really not a ton of options as far as games you can play but drinks are not super overpriced i found them to be pretty average for a bar downtown. Problem #1- I asked for my \"\"go to\"\" beer which is a pretty popular one but they didn't carry it so bartender suggested something similar and once I tried it I realized it was nothing like it like at all and several people said the same thing, so I let the bartender know and I give it back because there's no way I was gonna drink it or anyone in my party, the bottle was full minus a few sips and she still charged me for it which is fine I'm not gonna complain over a $6 drink. Problem #2 they have a \"\"vip\"\" area which people rent out but the only thing saying it's the vip area is a small sign which we completely missed as it it was our first time there so we enter since it looked pretty cool and we are immediately thrown out of the area with an EXTREMELY RUDE ATTITUDE. Problem #3 takes forever to get a drink and it wasn't even 9 pm so I'm assuming they weren't at their busiest time and there was already a line at the bar. Problem #4 bad service.

There were several choices for items to place inside. I picked bacon, spinach, colby cheese and basil pesto. One of the best omletes I have ever had. The service was amazing as well.

This place is definitely for a younger crowd who doesn't mind cramped seating, bad parking options, and a loud atmosphere. Coming here with friends is a great time, coming here with your parents is not. Regardless of which location you pick you can expect to drive around searching for parking and waiting to be seated unless you go during the off times. When I came to the Clintonville location I found it particularly hard to find parking because of where it's located in the strip. I highly recommend walking or using ride share to get there so you don't have to worry about the parking situation. In addition, I wouldn't say Condado's is a great place if you're looking for something that's handicap accessible. It is pretty tricky to maneuver in the restaurant since there are so many people and tables are fairly close together, but I'm sure if you mention it they would try to seat you closer to the front! \n\nWith that being said Condado's is an awesome place to come for tacos, margs on the rocks, and plenty of chips and dip (not free, you do have to pay!)! When I come here I love to build my own tacos and always opt for the Sweet Lucy shell (flour tortilla, corn tortilla, queso and guac layered together) as a base for my creations. I'm a huge fan of the braised beef brisket as well as the pulled pork for the filling, but also enjoy some of their excellent vegetarian options such as the Thai chili tofu. To change things up pair the brisket with the pineapple salsa, queso fresco, and the chipotle honey sauce! Yum. If you're not feeling creative they've got you covered with a set menu of tacos you can order from. I will also say the tacos are fairly large. If you're ordering chips and dip I suggest only getting 2 tacos as you'll fill up quicker than expected. \n\nAll in all once you make it inside it's a nice relaxing joint to chill out with some friends and enjoy some delicious food. If you're visiting Columbus a stop at one of the Condado Tacos locations should make your itinerary.\"</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>ocGlGgaJxlK-4OFtY9DDgw</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01T18:57:47.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>Truly discrimination at it's finest.

Also, the pineapple with cinnamon on went great with my meats. \n\nEveryone I talked to was friendly and very helpful and made me feel welcome.  Thank you!  \n\nI shall be back with friends!

I suspect it's amazing if you're eating all the cheesy and meaty stuff, but the other options are a hard BLECTHhhhtttthhhh. I'm NOT vegan, but I can't eat dairy and I'm trying to eat less meat. I wanted to try all the things and figured they'd make good leftovers, so I got the pate trio, the eggplant walnut-pate roll-up dealies, the smoked-bean stuffed-dough doohickey, the mushroom dumpling jobbers, and a side of the red pepper stuff (I don't recall the proper names of anything, sry). \n\nThe beet pate legit tasted moldy (don't ask me how I know what mold tastes like..?), the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on, and the spinach pate would've been good if it wasn't so salty. The eggplant walnut-pate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own.. it was basically just a mouthful of pate. The smoked-bean dough thing was SOooooooo effing salty.. and I'm not one to shy away from salt. I couldn't even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt, but it def could've used the extra flavor otherwise. The mushroom dumplings looked so good, and I LOVE all things mushroom (and dumpling!), but these were all mushroom and nothing else.. the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with. These just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a Friday night cuz they weren't invited to the onion and herb party at the Savory's.. They even got all dolled up in their dough dress and put on their best cracked pepper.. It was a pretty sad day in dumpling town..\n\nAll in all, my experience was pretty shMEHhhhh. I'd avoid this place if you're vegan or dairy-free. Im sure that puddle of cheesy eggy butter bread is orgasmic, and maybe the meat dishes are worth eating, but everything I ordered was really disappointing.. Although, the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty. Heavy on the fenugreek tho, which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it. The pita-like bread that came with the pate trio was good too, so if I eat there again (unlikely) I'll get the bread with a side of fenugreek-sweat surprise, and maybe I'll try the meat dumplings.. \n\nHopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they don't make any more super salty or moldy-tasting mistakes!\"</td><td>1</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>eY3-ZE8-njGOglACqFYqVQ</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-11T20:38:46.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5.0</td><td>LaBottega is our family's favorite restaurant in Vancouver!

I think it is pretty sad that I would expect their buffet pizza to be better quality, not sure if any locations still do that.\n\nAs for the experience.  I ordered through the app, easy enough.  When i arrived I came inside to this store which is pretty small.  There was a couple dining inside, but as I approached the counter I didn't see a worker at all.  I continued to stand there for 5-10 minutes and I didn't hear a peep.  I could see cooked pizzas at the end of the conveyor belt, but no action otherwise.  One thing that was in plain sight from the front counter was the grey metal mousetrap in the back room to the right of their entry door - again clearly visible from the customer counter, very appetizing, and gave me time to think about why it was there in that kitchen.\n\nFinally, someone came through the entry door (delivery guy back from his run) and he asked if I had been helped.  He then got ahold of the woman who was in the far back of the building, no clue what she was doing...but nothing pizza-making related.  Pizza was sub-par, light on the cheese, undercooked and just bad.\n\nI cant believe I'm saying this, but even Domino's has better pizza now...how the tides have turned.\"</td><td>1</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>BqKM8y3E9aFdxweD1_bwFA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-03-08T12:36:26.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>5.0</td><td>Moved here about a year ago and some months.....

This didn't really phase me because the people that recommended the place said their food was amazing, but their service was a little lacking. \nOnce I got back to the party, I opened my to go box to find some good sized delicious boneless wings and some really good beer battered fries. I wasn't even expecting fries, so that was a yummy surprise! There was some kind of seasoning on the fries reminiscent to the Arby's fries. The sauce on the wings was perfect. Every bite was full of flavor. I will definitely order to go again in the future. I can't wait to try all of the flavors!\"</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>jXAhxqQJe9xskg7c_mTk3w</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-04T19:20:14.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>Worste location avoid going on weekends.

The food here is delicious, there's great ambiance, and it's great for accommodating parties of all different sizes.\n\nMy friend and I came for dinner on a Thursday a little before 6 pm and it was surprisingly busy. We were able to get seated immediately though.\n\nThe restaurant has a great list of cocktails and alcoholic beverages (including happy hour!) which you don't find at most Indian restaurants. It's definitely a more upscale vibe.\n\nThe happy hour is a great deal. It runs Monday to Saturday 3-6 and 10 to close, as well as all day Sunday. There are daily drink specials (Thursday's was $2 off margaritas) as well small bites. I got the margarita as it was the special that day, and surprisingly it was pretty good. I'm picky with my margaritas and thought theirs was the best one I've had in a couple months. It wasn't too strong either.\n\nWe ordered a couple of apps to share and each ordered a curry.\n\nTandoori chicken (6 pieces for $16) was good. It comes with 3 chicken legs and 3 drumsticks. It's well flavored and moist. My friend didn't think it was spicy but I had a little trouble with it, since I'm extremely sensitive to spicy food.\n\nThe yellow daal fry ($12) was also really spicy. I couldn't eat more than a spoonful, which is unfortunate because it tasted delicious. We had asked them to make it mild so I'm guessing this is their version of mild...again my friend didn't think it was spicy but I really struggled with it.\n\nFor my main, I went with the fish curry ($16) and requested mild. Luckily this time it was actually mild. It was much sweeter than expected but not spicy at all, so I could actually eat it. They were generous with the fish chunks too. This was the first fish curry I've ever tried at an Indian restaurant but I'm very impressed.\n\nMy friend ordered the kadahi paneer ($14) and really enjoyed that too. We also ordered a couple of different breads (roti, paratha, and naan) along with a side of plain rice to eat with the curry.\n\nThe service was great. Our server was extremely attentive and even took away our empty plates and cups as we were finishing with them. We were in and out of here within an hour, which worked well with our schedule as we needed to catch a movie afterwards.\n\nThe meal cost ~$110 after tax and tip for the two of us, including one drink each and plenty of leftovers to take home!\"</td><td>3</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>j0VWgf2QhoxpTLnODZxnnw</td><td>1</td><td>2019-03-04T21:50:19.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>4.0</td><td>So I stopped in for breakfast and had the French Toast, bacon and eggs scrambled w/ cheese.

I was sticking to vegetarian options that night and ordered the Tsel Phaley and the vegetarian momos. \n\nThe Tsel Phaley was very interesting. It was basically vegetables and noodles rolled into a spongey-wrap (could almost equate it to an uthappam for anyone familiar with South Indian cuisine). I liked it, but it was pretty oily. This dish is definitely on the smaller side, more of an appetizer.\n\nThe vegetarian momos were pretty bland. Luckily, they had given us a few sauces and pickled vegetables which we were able to use to add a little more flavor. Would avoid getting these again. \n\nOther folks got the Sha Phaley (bread stuffed with beef), beef momos, and eggplant, which were all acceptable.\n\nWe also ordered one Tibetan tea, since some people had never tried it before. It came in a really adorable mug and was a lot less buttery than other Tibetan teas I have had, which I appreciated.\n\nOur waitress and servers were incredibly friendly. They were very accommodating when we asked if we could cut a cake we had brought to the restaurant separately. Also, we were all having such a nice time catching up that we ended up staying until closing (10 PM) and they never rushed us out or made it seem like we were inconveniencing them.\n\nOverall, was expecting more from the food but not a bad option for a casual meal with friends.\"</td><td>1</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>sZA0keiME0I0IXSh_zPZGw</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-14T22:32:01.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've been coming here for at least 12 years.

I'm generally quite introverted and am perfectly happy sitting on my couch, watching movies and shows, drinking red wine and coffee (sometimes one right after the other). I get especially excited for winter storms because I KNOW that nobody will dare ask me to go anywhere.\nWell, my friends and partner all wanted to go out for dinner as the first winter storm of 2019 was beginning. I really thought I could get out of it by telling them that I'm enjoying my weekend INDOORS. And by continuously telling them about the forecast. There was no winning with these extroverted people, so I ended up Orinoco.\nWell, I really had no regrets afterwards. I was actually HAPPY and GRATEFUL to them that we went out. There were very few people in the restaurant because of the snow, so we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves.\nPros: fun ambience and decor; GREAT food (I especially recommend the seared tuna, arepas, and empanadas)\nCon: the sangria tasted REALLY good, but it really doesn't feel like an alcoholic beverage. So, if you're looking to get buzzed... or tipsy... or drunk, the sangria won't do it for you.

What brought me to the shop is needing to get an estimate to the damage done to my Mazda when my shark fin antenna collided with my garage door which came down on it as I was backing out of my garage. The end result was that the antenna was riding up in the back about a quarter inch from the hood of my car additionally there were some dents from the impact in the hood.  I spoke with Ed when I arrived to VIP and he took a look at my car and we made an arrangement for me to come in several days later so that the mechanic could go under the headliner and check the antenna for damage and try to resecure the antenna. I brought my car in several days later at 9 AM and Ed was kind enough to offer to give me a ride home which I gladly accepted. I received a call from add about three hours later telling me that my car was already fixed he told me what the problem was and how the mechanic resecured my antenna and all was good he even fix the dents that were in my hood. He then asked if he could give me a lift back to the shop. The cost was really reasonable and frankly a little less than what I had expected to pay and my car looks beautiful. I'm happy that I found VIP I will definitely be recommending them to my friends and family who need collision repair work done this is a class act business and I want to give a special fat shout out and thank you to Ed and Tano who assisted me in the process thank you so much gentlemen.

Again, the food is amazing and our waiter was excellent. My husband and I first dined at Hollerbach's around 10 months ago. The weather was nice but cool enough for me to wear a sweater. Once we were seated I took off my grey wrap around sweater and place it on the seat next to me. Unfortunately we left without my sweater. I called the restaurant later that day and was told they did not have it. I was advised to call back in a    couple of days which I did. Again I was told they did not have it. I tried again a week later and was told the same thing. No sweater. We dined at Hollerbach's again 6 months later and of course I asked about my sweater only to be told they did not have it. So today we decided to make the 90 minute trip to Sanford and visit our favorite German restaurant and upon our arrival (approximately 2:00 PM) both our jaws hit the floor. The hostess who was stationed outside was WEARING MY SWEATER. I immediately told her I liked her sweater and asked her where she got it. She appeared to be shocked so I told her that I had the same sweater and that I had left it behind at this very restaurant. She responded by telling me she got it at Target. This sweater was purchased at Dillard's in Ocala, FL and was not a Target product. In addition to that, this young lady was swimming in this sweater which was a size 3X. I did ask our waiter about the lost and found policy being that he was fairly new, he was unsure. He did offer to get a manager, however, we declined since it's just going to be her word against mine. I don't know what angers me more....her lying to my face or being lied to by staff 10 months ago. Either way this incident has put a sour taste in my mouth and I don't care to be a patron of an establishment that has employees with such dicey personal morals.</td><td>1</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>ekH1kNKsEFS-yNhP5U433g</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-24T19:08:20.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>We ALL love it!

I actually went twice today because I took my dogs separately. Both experiences were absolutely positive. The groomer Brittany was soooooo awesome! One of my dogs has been orthopaedically-challenged since he was a puppy (he's now 12+-years old) and has never been able to walk a lot, which unfortunately means it's hard to wear his nails down naturally (i.e. his quiks are pretty long). Plus, he has all black nails. Despite that, Brittany still managed to give him a really nice pedicure! I literally cannot recall the last time his nails have looked this great (he's been in our family for 12 years...). Previously, I always took him to his vet or doggy daycare's grooming for his nail trims, but they never managed to give him such nice pedicures. Brittany is AMAZING! Brittany gave my other dog a lovely pedicure as well. \n\nMarcus at the register was also super awesome, helpful, and friendly =)\n\nPlease don't be dissuaded by the negative Yelp ratings for this store - the store may have been less-than-pleasant in the past, but I can wholeheartedly say that my experience here as been quite positive!

If you value your time and money, however...stay away!  I went here today to return an item my partner purchased a few days before.  I explained that I did not have the receipt but I did have the card it was paid with as well as a bank statement with the purchase information.  The item was a battery and I explained that the item was either not working properly or I wasn't using it properly and would like to return it.  All parts were in new condition.  Unfortunately, I ran into the return gestapo in the form of two male employees.  One employee began questioning me about the item and whether or not I had purchased it at that location, did I charge it, etc.  He said it looked like I hadn't even taken it out of the box.  I looked around for a sign with the return policy and there wasn't one, so I was confused about why they were asking so many questions.  The other male whispered something in his ear, which I thought to be very unprofessional.  Don't whisper something in front of a customer.  After the interrogation, the man stated that he could give me a store credit for the item and proceeded to walk away.  He then came back and stated that he couldn't give me a store credit and he didn't even think they carried the item.  So, I asked him if they did carry it.  He made it seem as though I had either stolen the item and wanted to return it or I had purchased from another store and was trying to return there.  The store manager then came out and stated that they do not do returns for that particular item.  He proceeded to look up the item in the computer and sure enough it was bought there 5 days prior.  He claims he told my partner there were no returns.  However, if the item is defective, they need to take it back.  Instead of testing the item or taking the time to explain how it works-maybe I was using it wrong- they told me to call the manufacturer for a refund.  Excuse me, but if I buy an item from that store and it is not working properly, it needs to be returned at that store.  I didn't buy it from the manufacturer, I bought it there!  Also, at one point the rude male employee actually laughed at me and stated that the reason it wasn't working is because I hadn't charged it.  Since he did not test it for himself, I'm confused about how he came to that conclusion.  Unfortunately, I will not be returning there even though it is right around the corner from me.</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>v7nOW3OKEyur2sBK1Q5WbQ</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-18T14:37:12.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2.0</td><td>\"Came here for all you can eat Korean bbq and sushi the atmosphere is pretty good its dim and modern plus it's on the second floor so there is a decent view the service however leaves a lot to be desired \n\nAs for the food I did enjoy the gomae and the lamb however I found the rest of the Korean bbq to be not as good as other places even the sushi the California roll for example had fishy taste to it so I didn't try much else  \n\nAll In all I probably would not come back some things adamantly were good however there are much better Korean bbq places as well as much better sushi places\"</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>IhzJK4M2lXL-ZFB9rOvDCQ</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-12T02:44:40.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>Absolutely awful.

Also under Oregon law, you should be able to get a full year's worth of birth control (pills) in a single prescription\n- If you are worried about what you would have to pay, give them a call beforehand and they can walk you through what you would be charged for.  The folks on the customer service line are super friendly and helpful\n- Don't worry about having to deal with protesters. The five times I have been there, there has only been a couple of times when some anti-choice people were sitting right outside the building limit with silly signs.  But don't let those losers bother you.\n\nWhen I briefly had insurance with Kaiser, I had a terrible OBGYN who basically botched my IUD insertion and failed to inform me of the effects it would have on my particular health condition.

Ordered steak tacos and fish tacos and both were horrible, I even asked for medium cooked steak with corn tortillas and it came out well done in a flour tortilla. Not at all the level of service you should get for their price. Unless you are starving and there or no other options, just don't go. You are better off at cookout up the street.</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>ijxjqHVPBmeNY41sFiBvtA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-06T14:35:42.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4.0</td><td>\"Delicious pies!!

An anticipated first-time visit for us - we arrived at the restaurant a few minutes before it opened at 11:30 am.\n\nThe restaurant is located about mid-way in a small and rather neat & tidy plaza of retail shops and services at the base of a high-rise tower, adjacent the Holdom Skytrain Station.  The restaurant is quite small, and cozy in its design, setup, colours, and decor.  The largest tables are arranged along the window, remaining tables along the one inside wall, and down the centre section, plus, there's a long counter & chair setup directly in front of, and beneath the chef's doing their thing in the kitchen.  For us, after getting settled into our table, it looked and 'felt' comfy.\n\nService to our table was friendly and helpful -- our server kept tea mugs full, and showed attentive-caring to our dining enjoyment.\n\nWhat was ordered:  dishes ordered arrived from kitchen to table in timely fashion and appropriate sequence -- all looking good -- and with 'warm' dishes nice and warm, 'cool' dishes 'the right' amount of cool -- my thoughts - \"\"as good as it gets\"\".  Dishes and ingredients listed as (mostly) described in the in-house menu.\n\n-  Lunch Special (one order) - Combination (mostly for Mom) - Philadelphia roll (avocado, salmon, cream cheese, smoked salmon on top), ebi (prawn) sunomono salad, and miso soup.  \n\n-  Lunch Special (two orders) - Chirashi (for daughter and I) - salmon, tuna, ebi (prawn), hokkigai (surf clam), tai (fish), tomago (egg), masago (fish roe), served on sushi rice, with unagi kabayaki sauce (bbq eel & soy based), and garnishes of shredded daikon, lemon slice, pickled ginger, and wasabi, and miso soup.\n\n-  A La Carte:  ika (squid) geso karaage (mostly for daughter and I), oyster motoyaki (for Mom), spicy agedashi tofu (w/spicy sauce on the side - shared), and korroke (sweet potato croquette - shared).\n\nNice presentations - colourful and inviting.  The preparations delicious -- ingredients of each, looking and tasting so fresh, very distinctly flavoured, and tasty.  Quality ingredients, prepared with attention and care.\n\nThe place was \"\"cool\"\", service good, and the food so fresh-tasting and well prepared.

We had a sushi course, robayataki course, and several small plates. The sushi was just ok, nothing particularly wowed us. The robayataki course was served all at once, so by the time we got to each part, the meats had gone cold and lost their important textures and flavors. The star was the miso cured sea bass, this is a favorite dish of ours and this iteration was very good.\n\nValue - While this can't be considered \"\"fine dining\"\" the value for money at PABU is 3/5.

The vegan options are plentiful, with things like spring rolls, noodle bowls, sautéed vegetables (like I can EVER resist bok choy?!) I think my eyes teared a bit looking at the menu, I swear. This is pretty much my favorite food on the planet.\n\nIt was a Friday night and people eat out on Friday nights, especially at 5 star places. The nicest lady at the host stand took my name and promised to text when a table was ready. And pay attention, because this is something that put this place over the top in the list of Joi B's favorite restaurants in the US (yes, Meyers & Chang, you're on it): when our table was ready 45 minutes later, we were at a cute pub right across the street, not minding a thing. The text informed us that our counter seats were ready. When I'm not dining alone, the last place in the world I want to sit is at a counter. Hell, even if I had been eating alone, I would have done so begrudgingly (and only if really hungry). So, I texted back and asked if it was OK if we waited a little longer for a table. The response was nothing short of wonderful. \"\"Sure, we can do that! It should be another half hour...\"\" Wow! I'm so used to high demand places acting like they are doing you a huge favor to seat you where you want (or NOT seat you where you don't want). It's just been my experience lately and I suppose I may have a chip on my shoulder about it. But this was such a breath of fresh air and will make me a forever customer.\n\nThe restaurant is loud and bustling, but it's a celebratory atmosphere, with people who are in love with their food. Can't beat that. Soon we were right there with them, as plate after plate arrived: the scallion pancakes (crispy/salty delicious), the BEST bok choy I've ever had, the so very transcendental tofu stirfry with slippery noodles (texture fest! And an extremely pleasing flavor) and crispy spring rolls that I devoured so quickly, they were barely even there. What I loved about these is all that swiss chard complicating things and making them better. Loved. Loved. Loved. It all.\n\nAnd they have cocktails (next time I have to try the homemade pineapple vodka), two of which feature mezcal, so hello. And a very decent Cava by the glass. Did I mention celebratory?

I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, and probably not the best Austin has to offer, but it is really good. Had a beef rib, smoked sausage, Mac, and their peach cobbler. The rib was HUGE! I didn't even get to finish it all because it was just too much. But damn was it nice. I think it could've been a bit more tender and juicy, but for the portion size it was still damn good, especially with their sauces on the table which I thought were fantastic. The sausage was good but nothing too special about it. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and creamy which I like, and being from Georgia, im a sucker for a good peach cobbler and theirs didn't disappoint!\n\nDrinks: I should title this beer, because it's beer galore! I tried something different which I didn't end up liking - should've gone for something lighter, but all in a they've got an incredible selection.\n\nAmbience: Typical BBQ spot with a casual yet still clean and polished vibe.\n\nPrice: This is where I had to dock them a star. The food was great don't get me wrong, but I thought it was way too overpriced.\n\nAll in all this'll definitely be a spot I'll try again when I'm in town, but there's definitely better places around if you manage to get lucky and catch them before they run out.\n\nSN: ***This Is My 100th Yelp Review!

Looking forward to stopping in for dinner sometime soon.</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>gGvNgShksetPoimyKV8I9Q</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-20T17:13:10.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>\"Please note this was at a Fooda location not the actual restaurant.

The chili was a major disappointment.  Perhaps they waved a jar of spices over the pan, but if so they didn't open it.  It was incredibly bland and underseasoned.

It's a small portion so this isn't a good bet if you're very hungry.  I love Flower Child and usually end up here with a girlfriend but even my husband will ask to eat here.</td><td>1</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>UxHdOAW-7pjH0NWdoUcf3g</td><td>0</td><td>2019-03-02T05:04:17.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>1.0</td><td>If I could give it 0 stars, I would.

After waiting for 20 minutes the hostess seated us very rudely. Our waiter wasn't any better. He had an arrogant demeanor and was very condescending. He put our order in late and we waited too long for the food to arrive. The burger taste like your uncle cooked it at the park with no seasoning. All of the dishes lacked flavor.

The sautéed spinach was tasty. \nMy entree was blackened salmon, black beans with rice and sautéed spinach. The spinach again was tasty and the salmon was not bad.

And since I knew my boyfriend was a concert goer I thought this would be a great way to start off the holidays. \n\nMy boyfriend has been to this location on several occasions, but as for me this was my first visit. Therefore, I trusted him with the navigation and parking. And to my luck, I made a great decision.  He knows the area pretty well, so we found parking in a jiffy. From our parking space to the venue we only had to walk approximately two blocks. Pretty good especially for the price we paid. \n\nAs we walked up to the building we fell in line with other concerts goers. The staff of the tabernacle did a fairly decent job organizing patrons in the outside line. They checked our bags at one checkpoint, then they wanded our bodies in the next checkpoint, and at the last checkpoint they checked for tickets. Pretty seamless and easy. \n\nAs we walked in I realized that this is the building I've walked/drove past on numerous occasions. The building looks to be an old place of worship. My thoughts on converting a place of worship to a concert venue are still undecided; however I believe the owners did an amazing job maintaining the integrity of the building. There approximately four levels to the building (I could be wrong but that's all I saw). If you walk straight in and downstairs to the basement floor you are greeted by two large bars on either side of the room. There is space for sitting, space to lean on table, places to drink, and even snagging a picture in the photo booth. The drinks and food are obviously overpriced, as any other venue or theme park would be. So don't be upset when you get hit with the bill. As you walk back up the stairs you notice the beauty of the architecture. The stairs are well preserved and so are the stained glass windows. The main floor is the concert area where you see a backdrop of an organ, that has to be decades old if I have to guess. Then above the empty space/standing room there is seating room on two additional levels.\n\nOverall I believe this concert venue deserves an A-. It is very spacious, the owners have maintained the integrity of the building, and I appreciate the multiple seats and spaces for people. Whether you like to stand and jump about of sit and sip this is pretty awesome. Pitfalls, the drinks and food are over priced and parking is hard to come by, unless you would like to pay about $15+ for parking.\"</td><td>1</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>5iasxw7Rl-BoVuueD9kOyA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-04T21:42:43.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>This is the worst experience I have ever had with any type of utility company.

However, a week later they came and filled our tank anyways even though we didn't want it. We explained how we were on will call and weren't planning to fill our tank until next winter and they said sorry all they could do at this point is offer me a payment plan. They said when a service check is made an auto fill order is generated even though we were on will call. We then explained how we could smell gas and asked if this was normal and they said they would have to send a tech out to check which may or may not cost us and they wouldn't know until they got there.

If you have some time to pass before your next FastPass, you can also ride this as the line isn't normally very long.</td><td>2</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>h1p9IZaKTkH8yFou2COqSg</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-19T16:48:22.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5.0</td><td>What a great dinner we had this fine restaurant last night!

The room was modern and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were numerous and soft, yet supportive. It was the perfect size for the two of us, but I could see how a family of four might struggle to find a spot for all of their luggage with the pull down bed open. The aesthetics were fantastic! Each section of the property really reflected the decade it was representing and was truly a lot of fun to walk through and look at. \n\nThe food court had plenty of options. Admittedly, we didn't eat there often, but the food options seemed very kid friendly as there was something for even the pickiest eaters. The prices were in-line with what you would expect from a Disney resort. The pizza slices were huge, as they're basically 1/4 of an entire pizza so the $9 price tag isn't the worst thing in the world. The one \"\"flaw\"\" would be that the free mugs you get for staying at the resort don't have any signs suggesting they are free with your stay. This seemed like a \"\"gotcha\"\" moment for a lot families who aren't informed. \n\nThe buses to the parks and Disney Springs are well laid out and easy to find. The bus schedules are posted throughout the front of the property so it was easy to plan what time you needed to be ready at the bus queue. It's also helpful that the app has the bus schedule as well to make planning easier. Pop Century has its own buses to and from the parks and doesn't make any stops like some of the All-Star resorts do, which is a nice bonus. Overall, I would definitely consider staying at Pop Century again as it was convenient and a great value for what we were looking for in a resort (a place to sleep, shower and get ready for the parks!)\"</td><td>2</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>gW29dw1Dt6fZ1Fw-Io5YyA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-15T05:28:45.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>I do not know why this place only has an average rating of 2.5 stars.

Not a lot of tables so I'm sure it can get pretty busy. The vibe of the place is very comfortable and casual. \n\nSERVICE\nIt was not busy (plenty of empty tables) but it took our waitress 10-15 to finally approach our table. At the end the hostess cleared our dessert plates and our waitress again didn't approach us for about 15-20 minutes. In between the food seemed to come out very slowly with the exception of our entrees. \n\nFOOD / BEVERAGE\nThis was really where the meal fell short for us. For appetizers we tried their tomato bisque and the brie plate. The tomato bisque was OK but not what I would typically expect from a bisque. The brie plate was WAY too sweet. It really needed something salty, savory, or spicy to balance out ALL the sweet things on the plate -- apples, strawberries, marmalade, honey. For the entree we got the sesame orange glazed salmon and the chicken saltimbocca. The salmon on its own was good, as was the broccolini that came with it, but the sauce was WAY too salty and the rice was under-seasoned. The chicken had a weird quality that made it look reheated which was not appealing. It lacked flavor and the sauce was not particularly great. The au gratin potatoes were a crowd favorite. For dessert we both got the apple crisp and it was truly the highlight of the meal. Absolutely perfect. \n\nRESTROOMS\nCute single stall restroom. They offer mouthwash which was a nice perk. \n\nDue to our experience I don't think we will be returning, but if you go definitely try the apple crisp.\"</td><td>1</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>0Dd1Cjt_XoVaEvPOkyBD-g</td><td>2</td><td>2019-02-20T00:30:51.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"**Update 2/19/2019**\n\nI still love this park! And, living nearby, I walk my dog here at least three times each day. I was recently checking out my past reviews and noticed this one and I realized I neglected to mention a few points about this park:\n-unlike most other dog parks (okay, unlike ALL other dog parks, really), this one is unfenced. So if your dog is not well socialized (like mine), or doesn't obey commands or isn't well trained (like mine), or if you're afraid he/she might run away if he/she sees a squirrel or a low-lying crow or God-knows-what (like mine), you'd best be advised to keep your dog on a leash at this park. I do. \n-there's a free-standing post in the park containing free doggie waste bags, if you forgot to bring some. Nice! PLEASE remember to pick up after your dog! \n-there are two stone sculptural reclining animals (a tiger and a lion, I think) at the north side of the park, closer to the Cambie Bridge, and these sculptures are actually water fountains for dogs (!). In the warmer months, metal dog bowls are placed under the sculptures' mouths and there's a button to push that will fill these bowls with water, so Fido can have a drink. Nice! \n-there's a super nice playground area for toddlers and kids hidden between two condo buildings to the east in the park, with a lot of benches nearby. This playground area is open to the public and has modern, modular pieces. (This playground is separate from the one directly under the Cambie Bridge, just a few steps away, literally).

I came in with high hopes of eating some delicious food based on the pictures but left hungry and unsatisfied as a result of poor table service. \nThe restaurant only does walk ins for parties smaller than a size of 8. We came in on a Friday evening and were seated right away by a lovely hostess( one star is for the hostess)\nThe best part of the menu is that it has several vegan/ vegetarian options which is great when outing with friends who only follow a vegan/vegetarian/ gluten free diet. \nThe main reason for our horrible experience was our server. Despite it not being too busy he would disappear for lengths of time. From seating to ordering it was about 45 mins. \nWe orders a round of appetizers(3 dishes) and entrees(3 dishes). Again, the wait from ordering to having a meal on the table was about an hour. BUT....we were only served our entrees! Our server looked confused when we inquired about the appetizer round and returned to let us know that he had forgotten to enter the order entirely!\nFor our main course we got burgers and butternut squash lasagna. I got the Cajun burger with sweet potato fries. It was good nothing to write home about(2nd star). The sweet potato fries were soggy. My friend who got the lasgna(a special) enjoyed her meal. The third person on our table also got a burger without a bun but the meal came with the bun!\nThrough our time there we noticed confused runners with regards to which food went to what table. We had a wrong order brought to us twice. It highlights that there seems to be no communication at all between the front and back of the house... this not on a busy night. I dread to think what chaos a busy evening would bring. \nWe were offered no compensation for the fact that 3 of the dishes we ordered didn't make the table.

Someone had to go and find her in a back room. She wasn't initially sure what cake I was talking about. I had to describe it to her.  The staff carried the pizza into the room while I carried the cake.  When it was time to serve the pizza our coordinator served the first piece to the boys and then left. I didn't see her again until I had finished cleaning up and was ready to leave, when she came in and asked if I needed anything else.  \nThe party coordinator did not help with cleaning between pizza and cake, serving the cake or cleaning up after so we could use the tables.  She did not engage with the boys at all during our time there, although I had told her that they all had special needs and would need attention.  \nMy son has a season's pass and we enjoy the facility.

They managed to have one table member's order come out wrong twice and service just wasn't good. The restaurant was, if I'm generous, maybe half full and I just can't figure out why we then watched another table that came in and ordered after ours (we were both 4 tops) have their drinks refilled twice before ours came out. The Bloody Sally/Mary I ordered took the entire meal to arrive (in fairness I ordered when the food was delivered) but at no point was there any acknowledgement by staff that our drinks had taken so long (11min wait for a Bloody in a basically empty restaurant). The Bloody was hopefully a fluke and it's normally good but it tasted like straight up shrimp cocktail sauce. I like a spicy or even unique take on a Bloody Mary but this isn't it - whatever their 'made from scratch' recipe is needs a rework.</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>XqNgfxyXP3kz8t3iG8ehZA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-18T21:16:03.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"This is my new favorite vegan spot.

I've heard many great things about this place and its chicken and thought it'd be a great place to catch up with old friends.\n\nWe came in yesterday around 6:30p or so, about an hour after opening. It looked like a slow night and we were seated promptly. We were given water and silverware while we were waiting on another person. Things were looking good for this establishment so far.\nWhen the last member of our party arrived we were ready to order. One of my friends ordered 5 drumsticks. The waitress told us to hold on a second and hurried away. She came back to say they were out of drumsticks but had exactly 5 left for my friend. That was interesting... We continued ordering.\nOne of my friends ordered 5 chicken tenders with sauce on the side and no fries. Another friend ordered a pint of Bluemoon and some dumplings. My other friend ordered the kimchi fries with just regular cut fries.\nI wanted to order the drumsticks, but since they suddenly ran out, I tried to order the wings. The waitress told me they ran out of wings without checking, so I settled for the tenders and a side of waffle fries. I felt a little disappointed since I was eager to try their drumsticks, not the tenders.\nOur food came out and there were mix ups. I didn't get my side of fries and my other friend who ordered the tenders got the fries instead. My friend who ordered the kimchi fries with regular cut fries received waffle fries. It was probably just a simple mistake. We didn't call the waitress over and just made do. It wasn't too big of a deal.\nThe food was good. I tried my friend's drumstick and it was great. The chicken tenders paled in comparison. They were decent, but they weren't anything special like the drumstick. The fries were crispy and satisfying. My friends enjoyed their food. But this is where the dining experience went downhill.\nWe asked for 5 separate checks. The waitress said sure, but came back after a few minutes. She said they were only allowed to split checks 4 ways, but that she was willing to split it 5 ways. We thanked her for being kind enough to do that and she walked away. However, when she came back the checks were very messed up.\nMy friend was charged for the fries he never ordered, my bill only charged me only for the tenders and not the fries, but my friend who ordered the dumplings and pint of beer was charged with an entree of chicken tenders that she never ordered.\nThe latter of the charges was alarming, so we called the waitress over. After much explaining, she finally took the charge for the entree of chicken tenders off. We paid, tipped, and were on our way.\n\nOverall, the experience was not great. I didn't understand how they could be out of drumsticks and wings after being open for an hour or so. It didn't make sense. It was a slow night. There were two, maybe three, other groups. For a place that's open until 1-2am, you would think they'd have enough chicken.....\nThe mix up with the food wasn't great, but tolerable. Mistakes happen. My friends and I were okay with it, but it dampened the experience.\n\nThe food was good. The drumsticks and fries tasted great, but the tenders were just decent. My friends and I enjoyed the food we received.\n\nHowever, the check mix up was just awful. How did my friend get charged for an entree she never ordered? Those mystery chicken tenders never made it to the table, but they certainly found their way onto my friend's bill.\n\nIn short, the food was pretty okay but the experience certainly left much to be desired. I'm not sure if the quality of food is worth the poor service. I don't know if I would consider coming back to this establishment after this first experience.\"</td><td>1</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>CDwUv7RiWSbRSLhpGZV2cQ</td><td>0</td><td>2019-03-04T15:12:46.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3.0</td><td>\"Pros: Very cool, modern hotel.

I reiterated how I told the tech repeatedly that he was burning my nails and then he was being too hard with the nail file. She laughed and said it wasn't on purpose. I sure hope not!

I can't measure the value against how long you'd wait in line as I went on a Wednesday evening with a short line. If I were to guess though, it's worth going if the wait is under an hour.\n\nIt's good to have a top BBQ spot in Austin open for dinner. Though it may not be on the level of Franklin's or la Barbecue, Terry Black's Barbecue is a premiere BBQ experience especially for a large place open for dinner. \n\nMeats:\nReally like the Brisket and Jalapeño cheese sausage.\nBeef ribs were a little dry despite having too much hardened fat layers. I did not try the pork ribs.\nAs others said, the brisket is salty so grab some complimentary white bread by the utensils area, which also offers free pickle slices and limes. Get a Jalapeño pepper or 2 for 35 cents each. \n\nSides: Cole slaw was ok. Cornbread is excellent. Huge muffins that are soft and not too dry. \n\nDessert: Banana Pudding has a few chunks of banana. It was ok.\n\nOverall, it's a very fun place to grab dinner. Go with a group, grab some beer or wine from the iced station while you're in line with your tray. Everyone's incredibly friendly. Nice to have unlimited white bread and pickles.\n\nYou can get smaller portions so instead of ordering a whole pound of sausage you can just order a link.\n\nCall them to get expected line-wait time and what meat is still available. \n\n4.5 stars so I'll round up to 5.\"</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>_0jwczJo5LaSo8e6liyS4Q</td><td>3</td><td>2019-01-14T17:47:11.000Z</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3.0</td><td>Coffee shop within the Atlanta History Center.

Probably because I'm used to more sweet milk teas, this had more of a tea taste. \n\nRaspberry White Chocolate Rose: 4/5 - I really enjoyed this flavour. I'm already a fan of Raspberry White Chocolate ice-cream but that added flavour of rose just made it even better! It was a settle rose taste the lingers after your take a bite, not too over powering. \n\nLychee Osmanthus: 5/5 - Now this flavour I loved!!!! It had a fruity and floral vibe to it which went really well together. Sometimes I find lychee flavoured things too sweet but I think the osmanthus helped cut that a bit and balanced it out really well. It has a very light flavour, it was really good. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try. \n\nViet Coffee: 3/5 - I'm not a big fan of coffee flavoured stuff but this one wasn't bad. It wasn't too bitter or too sweet.

Every morning afternoon and evening there were animals right outside the balcony grazing. My favorite had to be the giraffes and ostriches! We had a suite that could sleep up to eight which was perfect for our family since we have seven. The suite had two bedrooms and three bathrooms with a living room that also had a pull out couch and a pullout loveseat. We even had enough room to have my five cousins over and play cards right in the living room one of the nights. The suite also had a kitchen with the dishwasher, so if you were staying for a longer period of time you could certainly do your own cooking right in the room. The hotel was busy when we stayed, but we heard no noise from the other rooms or the hallways once we were in the suite, so they have good insulation, which makes a big difference. We stayed at the Kidani Village vs the Jambo House, which is a bit smaller, so if you can spring for that then you'll have the better animals and smaller number of people around.</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>BHQhlH9EPsumn2xAfvr4Jg</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-10T18:50:01.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>Delicious gentrified tacos!

I like the variety they offer in their menu and the cashier seemed nice so it was off to a good start. It was an interesting concept, order your food and then sit and wait while your order is brought to you. I got the pernil sandwich with yuca fries, croquettas, a cafe con leche, and an OJ. The pernil sandwich was pretty good. Yuca fries had a great cilantro garlic sauce however it may have been a little too much. Maybe offer to have it on the side, some of the yuca were so drenched that the middle became soggy. Croquettas were ok, nothing to write home about. Cafe con leche was good, maybe a little too much milk for my liking. OJ was average, nothing special. Overall experience was average. I ended up getting my food before I got my drinks which was weird. I would have thought drinks would come first or at least offer water for your guests. A couple sitting next to me ate their whole meal before they were able to get anyone to bring them water. The overall service could have been better. The food was very good though so might give it another try.</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>6aQ3FGZYJ506O1qHQUvC5Q</td><td>0</td><td>2019-03-24T21:55:01.000Z</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"The museum tour was really amazing.

The service was horrible! The place was not busy at all when my group and I went in. The waitress told us to go sit down at a table instead of guiding us there which was great because we could sit where we wanted to sit. Never been here before so we were trying to figure out what to order and the waitress didn't give us any suggestions. When our orders were finally in, we got our food at very different times. I asked for fried dumplings and only the bottom portion was actually fried. I've been to other restaurants where they fry the whole thing so I was pretty thrown off by that, but that was okay. The waitress never came over to ask how everything was. Never refilled our water. Just put the food down wherever without making sure it was for the right person. So overall, we decided not to tip for a service where they literally put the food down and walked away. As we were leaving, the waitress comes after us saying \"\"no tip?\"\" and we respond \"\"no\"\". She didn't ask why or what she could do to improve and immediately went to get the manager. Now I don't know his name, but he was so rude. First it seemed like he was trying to understand why, but overall he was just trying to get us to pay a tip which the waitress did not deserve. Everything was explained to him and then he starts saying \"\"oh they shouldn't clean the tables or refill the water or take your orders\"\". This was just out right rude. Honestly I could have placed an order and picked it up from the kitchen myself and it would have been the same service. Then the manager comes outside after we finally leave and tried to continue to have the conversation with us. That's just out right harassment. Before we left, be was like \"\"oh you come in here all the time and don't pay the tip\"\".

We had made reservations and got seated immediately which was nice. The restaurant wasn't all that busy- then again, it was a Tuesday night. We sat down and a few people ordered the $5 mule. The waitress said they had run out of strawberry and passion fruit, so one friend ordered lime, and the other ordered cucumber. The waitress brought back 2 lime drinks. She corrected it once she found out. I ordered a clam chowder soup (it's described as being very popular at this restaurant) and a quinoa and avocado Powerbowl. My friend ordered a steak well done. My other friends ordered various things. I expected my soup to get to me before my food did, but I sat there in 45 minutes to an hour of hungry misery, and all my friends started getting antsy for their own food. I was about to tell the waitress to forget about the soup when she finally brought all the food to us. She told me she'd get me a spoon and be right back, but as I ate my powerbowl, I realized she must have forgotten, because 15 minutes went by with no spoon. Well I wasn't going to let my soup go cold, so I drank it like the orphan in Oliver Twist. The soup itself was very delicious, and I can see why it's popular. To quote Oliver Twist, \"\"Please sir, I want some more.\"\"\nHowever, the avocado and quinoa powerbowl was a bit disappointing. The dressing was nowhere to be found when you first look at it- I finally saw it at the bottom of the dish in small clumps on one side of the plate. My friend's steak was definitely not well done (more like medium). When he sent it back to be cooked more, he had to wait so long we were all done with our meals. He asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said well done steaks take longer than less cooked steaks. Well yes, obviously, except we just expected the chef to cook that same steak more thoroughly. I guess they had to heat up a whole new steak???\nEither way, my friends argued that they wanted the steak comped for the inconvenience, and then pointed out my missing spoon. The waitress sheepishly apologized. I feel her pain- I used to be a waitress. I understand the frustrations of forgetting something simple or being blamed for the steak that the kitchen can't seem to cook well. Girl, I know how you feel. \nNevertheless, I wouldn't go back here except maybe to try the brunch.

I also asked them to come AFTER 1pm so my daughter would be home to receive them.\n\nThe day of delivery the delivery driver showed up before 12:30! I was so saddened to find out my daughter wouldn't be home when they were delivered. The bouquet was filled with the cheapest flowers you could possibly have. I didn't pay a lot, as it was for a 13 year old but for $25 I did expect 1-2 nicer flowers like a rose. It nearly was all carnations. \nIt's too bad it didn't live up to my expectation or what I would have thought would make it a more valuable purchase. I guess I will stick to New Seasons and Trader Joe's! For $25 I can get some really nice flowers!\nOh! And they charged me $10 for a 4 min drive.

I am so glad I came to Sofrito while I was in town for business. I'm returning to Orlando in December and already can't wait to eat here again. \n\nI had a pork cachapa and it was fantastic. For anyone interested in trying this (a) you absolutely should and (b) you should share it because it's HUGE. The corn cachapa is sweet and delicious. The cheese inside is gooey and amazing. The pork was tender and nicely brought the dish together. \n\nI was really indecisive and love Latin food, so I also had the sweet plantains and churros. Both were also well executed - but I can't stop thinking about the cachapa. \n\n**Update: I've been back 2 times since my original review, taking people with me each time.

It really is a great spot, especially if you're shopping at the domain and want to drop in at non-peak times, since it will get pretty busy! I love the option to sit at the bar if you've got a small party (1-2) where it's first come first serve. It's our go-to spot when we're craving Japanese beer, which they have on tap! My favorite is the spicy chicken ramen, which I get at the spiciest level - good heat, nice veggies, some umami flavor, thin noodles. We've had a number of the appetizers here as well, standouts being the brussel sprouts and crispy chicken. They've also got great combos, where you can add on things like crispy chicken + salad to a ramen order, which my fiance and I will often split as some food to go with our beers. \n\nMy only real complaint is the service, which leaves something to be desired. We'll often have to ask for things twice, or go hunt down waiters to ask for more water, napkins, etc. Once, we ordered drinks, and only got it after we waited 20 minutes for our food.

I'm sure she would have found anything we requested to make us happy. \n  The pizza was great! We had the vegan veggie slice and a pepperoni and mushroom.

This place is definitely for a younger crowd who doesn't mind cramped seating, bad parking options, and a loud atmosphere. Coming here with friends is a great time, coming here with your parents is not. Regardless of which location you pick you can expect to drive around searching for parking and waiting to be seated unless you go during the off times. When I came to the Clintonville location I found it particularly hard to find parking because of where it's located in the strip. I highly recommend walking or using ride share to get there so you don't have to worry about the parking situation. In addition, I wouldn't say Condado's is a great place if you're looking for something that's handicap accessible. It is pretty tricky to maneuver in the restaurant since there are so many people and tables are fairly close together, but I'm sure if you mention it they would try to seat you closer to the front! \n\nWith that being said Condado's is an awesome place to come for tacos, margs on the rocks, and plenty of chips and dip (not free, you do have to pay!)! When I come here I love to build my own tacos and always opt for the Sweet Lucy shell (flour tortilla, corn tortilla, queso and guac layered together) as a base for my creations. I'm a huge fan of the braised beef brisket as well as the pulled pork for the filling, but also enjoy some of their excellent vegetarian options such as the Thai chili tofu. To change things up pair the brisket with the pineapple salsa, queso fresco, and the chipotle honey sauce! Yum.

The smoked-bean dough thing was SOooooooo effing salty.. and I'm not one to shy away from salt.

We were able to get seated immediately though.\n\nThe restaurant has a great list of cocktails and alcoholic beverages (including happy hour!) which you don't find at most Indian restaurants. It's definitely a more upscale vibe.\n\nThe happy hour is a great deal. It runs Monday to Saturday 3-6 and 10 to close, as well as all day Sunday.

Luckily this time it was actually mild. It was much sweeter than expected but not spicy at all, so I could actually eat it. They were generous with the fish chunks too. This was the first fish curry I've ever tried at an Indian restaurant but I'm very impressed.\n\nMy friend ordered the kadahi paneer ($14) and really enjoyed that too. We also ordered a couple of different breads (roti, paratha, and naan) along with a side of plain rice to eat with the curry.\n\nThe service was great.

Again, the food is amazing and our waiter was excellent. My husband and I first dined at Hollerbach's around 10 months ago. The weather was nice but cool enough for me to wear a sweater. Once we were seated I took off my grey wrap around sweater and place it on the seat next to me. Unfortunately we left without my sweater. I called the restaurant later that day and was told they did not have it. I was advised to call back in a    couple of days which I did. Again I was told they did not have it. I tried again a week later and was told the same thing. No sweater. We dined at Hollerbach's again 6 months later and of course I asked about my sweater only to be told they did not have it. So today we decided to make the 90 minute trip to Sanford and visit our favorite German restaurant and upon our arrival (approximately 2:00 PM) both our jaws hit the floor. The hostess who was stationed outside was WEARING MY SWEATER. I immediately told her I liked her sweater and asked her where she got it. She appeared to be shocked so I told her that I had the same sweater and that I had left it behind at this very restaurant. She responded by telling me she got it at Target. This sweater was purchased at Dillard's in Ocala, FL and was not a Target product. In addition to that, this young lady was swimming in this sweater which was a size 3X. I did ask our waiter about the lost and found policy being that he was fairly new, he was unsure. He did offer to get a manager, however, we declined since it's just going to be her word against mine.

Myers & Chang was just what I needed the other night, and perhaps every night that I need to eat. What do I need? Why, a bunch of sizzling tasty Asian small plates! Always. The vegan options are plentiful, with things like spring rolls, noodle bowls, sautéed vegetables (like I can EVER resist bok choy?!) I think my eyes teared a bit looking at the menu, I swear. This is pretty much my favorite food on the planet.\n\nIt was a Friday night and people eat out on Friday nights, especially at 5 star places. The nicest lady at the host stand took my name and promised to text when a table was ready. And pay attention, because this is something that put this place over the top in the list of Joi B's favorite restaurants in the US (yes, Meyers & Chang, you're on it): when our table was ready 45 minutes later, we were at a cute pub right across the street, not minding a thing. The text informed us that our counter seats were ready. When I'm not dining alone, the last place in the world I want to sit is at a counter. Hell, even if I had been eating alone, I would have done so begrudgingly (and only if really hungry). So, I texted back and asked if it was OK if we waited a little longer for a table. The response was nothing short of wonderful. \"\"Sure, we can do that! It should be another half hour...\"\" Wow! I'm so used to high demand places acting like they are doing you a huge favor to seat you where you want (or NOT seat you where you don't want). It's just been my experience lately and I suppose I may have a chip on my shoulder about it. But this was such a breath of fresh air and will make me a forever customer.\n\nThe restaurant is loud and bustling, but it's a celebratory atmosphere, with people who are in love with their food. Can't beat that. Soon we were right there with them, as plate after plate arrived: the scallion pancakes (crispy/salty delicious), the BEST bok choy I've ever had, the so very transcendental tofu stirfry with slippery noodles (texture fest! And an extremely pleasing flavor) and crispy spring rolls that I devoured so quickly, they were barely even there. What I loved about these is all that swiss chard complicating things and making them better. Loved. Loved. Loved. It all.\n\nAnd they have cocktails (next time I have to try the homemade pineapple vodka), two of which feature mezcal, so hello. And a very decent Cava by the glass. Did I mention celebratory? I wasn't celebrating anything in particular, admittedly, but Meyers & Chang sure put me in the mood.\"","what a darling place myers chang was just what i needed the other night and perhaps every night that i need to eat what do i need why a bunch of sizzling tasty asian small plates always the vegan options are plentiful with things like spring rolls noodle bowls sautéed vegetables like i can ever resist bok choy i think my eyes teared a bit looking at the menu i swear this is pretty much my favorite food on the planet it was a friday night and people eat out on friday nights especially at star places the nicest lady at the host stand took my name and promised to text when a table was ready and pay attention because this is something that put this place over the top in the list of joi bs favorite restaurants in the us yes meyers chang you are on it when our table was ready minutes later we were at a cute pub right across the street not minding a thing the text informed us that our counter seats were ready when I am not dining alone the last place in the world i want to sit is at a counter hell even if i had been eating alone i would have done so begrudgingly and only if really hungry so i texted back and asked if it was ok if we waited a little longer for a table the response was nothing short of wonderful sure we can do that it should be another half hour wow I am so used to high demand places acting like they are doing you a huge favor to seat you where you want or not seat you where you do not want its just been my experience lately and i suppose i may have a chip on my shoulder about it but this was such a breath of fresh air and will make me a forever customer the restaurant is loud and bustling but its a celebratory atmosphere with people who are in love with their food cannot beat that soon we were right there with them as plate after plate arrived the scallion pancakes crispysalty delicious the best bok choy I have ever had the so very transcendental tofu stirfry with slippery noodles texture fest and an extremely pleasing flavor and crispy spring rolls that i devoured so quickly they were barely even there what i loved about these is all that swiss chard complicating things and making them better loved loved loved it all and they have cocktails next time i have to try the homemade pineapple vodka two of which feature mezcal so hello and a very decent cava by the glass did i mention celebratory i was not celebrating anything in particular admittedly but meyers chang sure put me in the mood",18],["yMhcpEgbb8488oLN-5RVkA",0,"2019-02-12",0,2,1.0,"When we first ate here the pizza was delicious.

I think it could've been a bit more tender and juicy, but for the portion size it was still damn good, especially with their sauces on the table which I thought were fantastic. The sausage was good but nothing too special about it. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and creamy which I like, and being from Georgia, im a sucker for a good peach cobbler and theirs didn't disappoint!\n\nDrinks: I should title this beer, because it's beer galore!

The room was modern and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were numerous and soft, yet supportive. It was the perfect size for the two of us, but I could see how a family of four might struggle to find a spot for all of their luggage with the pull down bed open. The aesthetics were fantastic! Each section of the property really reflected the decade it was representing and was truly a lot of fun to walk through and look at. \n\nThe food court had plenty of options. Admittedly, we didn't eat there often, but the food options seemed very kid friendly as there was something for even the pickiest eaters. The prices were in-line with what you would expect from a Disney resort. The pizza slices were huge, as they're basically 1/4 of an entire pizza so the $9 price tag isn't the worst thing in the world. The one \"\"flaw\"\" would be that the free mugs you get for staying at the resort don't have any signs suggesting they are free with your stay. This seemed like a \"\"gotcha\"\" moment for a lot families who aren't informed. \n\nThe buses to the parks and Disney Springs are well laid out and easy to find. The bus schedules are posted throughout the front of the property so it was easy to plan what time you needed to be ready at the bus queue. It's also helpful that the app has the bus schedule as well to make planning easier. Pop Century has its own buses to and from the parks and doesn't make any stops like some of the All-Star resorts do, which is a nice bonus. Overall, I would definitely consider staying at Pop Century again as it was convenient and a great value for what we were looking for in a resort (a place to sleep, shower and get ready for the parks!)\"","for being classified as one of disneys value resorts pop century felt like it was a good bit above the rest the room was modern and very clean the bed was comfortable and the pillows were numerous and soft yet supportive it was the perfect size for the two of us but i could see how a family of four might struggle to find a spot for all of their luggage with the pull down bed open the aesthetics were fantastic each section of the property really reflected the decade it was representing and was truly a lot of fun to walk through and look at the food court had plenty of options admittedly we did not eat there often but the food options seemed very kid friendly as there was something for even the pickiest eaters the prices were inline with what you would expect from a disney resort the pizza slices were huge as they are basically of an entire pizza so the price tag is not the worst thing in the world the one flaw would be that the free mugs you get for staying at the resort do not have any signs suggesting they are free with your stay this seemed like a gotcha moment for a lot families who are not informed the buses to the parks and disney springs are well laid out and easy to find the bus schedules are posted throughout the front of the property so it was easy to plan what time you needed to be ready at the bus queue its also helpful that the app has the bus schedule as well to make planning easier pop century has its own buses to and from the parks and does not make any stops like some of the allstar resorts do which is a nice bonus overall i would definitely consider staying at pop century again as it was convenient and a great value for what we were looking for in a resort a place to sleep shower and get ready for the parks",2],["g9-5_jy4TurUXNi1xWpWRg",0,"2019-03-06",0,3,1.0,"Something seriously wrong with the burger, tasted like dirt - dirty grill or dirty equipment?

It really needed something salty, savory, or spicy to balance out ALL the sweet things on the plate -- apples, strawberries, marmalade, honey. For the entree we got the sesame orange glazed salmon and the chicken saltimbocca. The salmon on its own was good, as was the broccolini that came with it, but the sauce was WAY too salty and the rice was under-seasoned. The chicken had a weird quality that made it look reheated which was not appealing. It lacked flavor and the sauce was not particularly great. The au gratin potatoes were a crowd favorite.

I didn't get my side of fries and my other friend who ordered the tenders got the fries instead. My friend who ordered the kimchi fries with regular cut fries received waffle fries. It was probably just a simple mistake. We didn't call the waitress over and just made do. It wasn't too big of a deal.\nThe food was good. I tried my friend's drumstick and it was great. The chicken tenders paled in comparison. They were decent, but they weren't anything special like the drumstick. The fries were crispy and satisfying. My friends enjoyed their food. But this is where the dining experience went downhill.\nWe asked for 5 separate checks. The waitress said sure, but came back after a few minutes. She said they were only allowed to split checks 4 ways, but that she was willing to split it 5 ways. We thanked her for being kind enough to do that and she walked away. However, when she came back the checks were very messed up.\nMy friend was charged for the fries he never ordered, my bill only charged me only for the tenders and not the fries, but my friend who ordered the dumplings and pint of beer was charged with an entree of chicken tenders that she never ordered.\nThe latter of the charges was alarming, so we called the waitress over. After much explaining, she finally took the charge for the entree of chicken tenders off. We paid, tipped, and were on our way.\n\nOverall, the experience was not great. I didn't understand how they could be out of drumsticks and wings after being open for an hour or so. It didn't make sense. It was a slow night. There were two, maybe three, other groups. For a place that's open until 1-2am, you would think they'd have enough chicken.....\nThe mix up with the food wasn't great, but tolerable. Mistakes happen. My friends and I were okay with it, but it dampened the experience.\n\nThe food was good. The drumsticks and fries tasted great, but the tenders were just decent. My friends and I enjoyed the food we received.\n\nHowever, the check mix up was just awful. How did my friend get charged for an entree she never ordered? Those mystery chicken tenders never made it to the table, but they certainly found their way onto my friend's bill.\n\nIn short, the food was pretty okay but the experience certainly left much to be desired. I'm not sure if the quality of food is worth the poor service. I don't know if I would consider coming back to this establishment after this first experience.\"","i never really write reviews but i feel like this place deserves it this was my first time at college roadhouse I have heard many great things about this place and its chicken and thought it would be a great place to catch up with old friends we came in yesterday around p or so about an hour after opening it looked like a slow night and we were seated promptly we were given water and silverware while we were waiting on another person things were looking good for this establishment so far when the last member of our party arrived we were ready to order one of my friends ordered drumsticks the waitress told us to hold on a second and hurried away she came back to say they were out of drumsticks but had exactly left for my friend that was interesting we continued ordering one of my friends ordered chicken tenders with sauce on the side and no fries another friend ordered a pint of bluemoon and some dumplings my other friend ordered the kimchi fries with just regular cut fries i wanted to order the drumsticks but since they suddenly ran out i tried to order the wings the waitress told me they ran out of wings without checking so i settled for the tenders and a side of waffle fries i felt a little disappointed since i was eager to try their drumsticks not the tenders our food came out and there were mix ups i did not get my side of fries and my other friend who ordered the tenders got the fries instead my friend who ordered the kimchi fries with regular cut fries received waffle fries it was probably just a simple mistake we did not call the waitress over and just made do it was not too big of a deal the food was good i tried my friends drumstick and it was great the chicken tenders paled in comparison they were decent but they were not anything special like the drumstick the fries were crispy and satisfying my friends enjoyed their food but this is where the dining experience went downhill we asked for separate checks the waitress said sure but came back after a few minutes she said they were only allowed to split checks ways but that she was willing to split it ways we thanked her for being kind enough to do that and she walked away however when she came back the checks were very messed up my friend was charged for the fries he never ordered my bill only charged me only for the tenders and not the fries but my friend who ordered the dumplings and pint of beer was charged with an entree of chicken tenders that she never ordered the latter of the charges was alarming so we called the waitress over after much explaining she finally took the charge for the entree of chicken tenders off we paid tipped and were on our way overall the experience was not great i did not understand how they could be out of drumsticks and wings after being open for an hour or so it did not make sense it was a slow night there were two maybe three other groups for a place that is open until am you would think they would have enough chicken the mix up with the food was not great but tolerable mistakes happen my friends and i were okay with it but it dampened the experience the food was good the drumsticks and fries tasted great but the tenders were just decent my friends and i enjoyed the food we received however the check mix up was just awful how did my friend get charged for an entree she never ordered those mystery chicken tenders never made it to the table but they certainly found their way onto my friends bill in short the food was pretty okay but the experience certainly left much to be desired I am not sure if the quality of food is worth the poor service i do not know if i would consider coming back to this establishment after this first experience",1],["TU-MYM548DAVweH8Xa0OSA",0,"2019-01-14",0,1,5.0,"I lived near the mall and this was my to go place at any time.

The pernil sandwich was pretty good. Yuca fries had a great cilantro garlic sauce however it may have been a little too much. Maybe offer to have it on the side, some of the yuca were so drenched that the middle became soggy. Croquettas were ok, nothing to write home about. Cafe con leche was good, maybe a little too much milk for my liking. OJ was average, nothing special. Overall experience was average. I ended up getting my food before I got my drinks which was weird. I would have thought drinks would come first or at least offer water for your guests.

The service was horrible! The place was not busy at all when my group and I went in. The waitress told us to go sit down at a table instead of guiding us there which was great because we could sit where we wanted to sit. Never been here before so we were trying to figure out what to order and the waitress didn't give us any suggestions. When our orders were finally in, we got our food at very different times. I asked for fried dumplings and only the bottom portion was actually fried. I've been to other restaurants where they fry the whole thing so I was pretty thrown off by that, but that was okay. The waitress never came over to ask how everything was. Never refilled our water. Just put the food down wherever without making sure it was for the right person. So overall, we decided not to tip for a service where they literally put the food down and walked away. As we were leaving, the waitress comes after us saying \"\"no tip?\"\" and we respond \"\"no\"\". She didn't ask why or what she could do to improve and immediately went to get the manager. Now I don't know his name, but he was so rude. First it seemed like he was trying to understand why, but overall he was just trying to get us to pay a tip which the waitress did not deserve. Everything was explained to him and then he starts saying \"\"oh they shouldn't clean the tables or refill the water or take your orders\"\". This was just out right rude. Honestly I could have placed an order and picked it up from the kitchen myself and it would have been the same service. Then the manager comes outside after we finally leave and tried to continue to have the conversation with us. That's just out right harassment.

We had made reservations and got seated immediately which was nice. The restaurant wasn't all that busy- then again, it was a Tuesday night. We sat down and a few people ordered the $5 mule. The waitress said they had run out of strawberry and passion fruit, so one friend ordered lime, and the other ordered cucumber. The waitress brought back 2 lime drinks. She corrected it once she found out. I ordered a clam chowder soup (it's described as being very popular at this restaurant) and a quinoa and avocado Powerbowl. My friend ordered a steak well done. My other friends ordered various things. I expected my soup to get to me before my food did, but I sat there in 45 minutes to an hour of hungry misery, and all my friends started getting antsy for their own food. I was about to tell the waitress to forget about the soup when she finally brought all the food to us. She told me she'd get me a spoon and be right back, but as I ate my powerbowl, I realized she must have forgotten, because 15 minutes went by with no spoon. Well I wasn't going to let my soup go cold, so I drank it like the orphan in Oliver Twist. The soup itself was very delicious, and I can see why it's popular. To quote Oliver Twist, \"\"Please sir, I want some more.\"\"\nHowever, the avocado and quinoa powerbowl was a bit disappointing. The dressing was nowhere to be found when you first look at it- I finally saw it at the bottom of the dish in small clumps on one side of the plate. My friend's steak was definitely not well done (more like medium). When he sent it back to be cooked more, he had to wait so long we were all done with our meals. He asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said well done steaks take longer than less cooked steaks. Well yes, obviously, except we just expected the chef to cook that same steak more thoroughly. I guess they had to heat up a whole new steak???\nEither way, my friends argued that they wanted the steak comped for the inconvenience, and then pointed out my missing spoon. The waitress sheepishly apologized. I feel her pain- I used to be a waitress. I understand the frustrations of forgetting something simple or being blamed for the steak that the kitchen can't seem to cook well. Girl, I know how you feel. \nNevertheless, I wouldn't go back here except maybe to try the brunch.

When you stop here, you MUST order the doughnuts!!\n\nI ate here on a Saturday around 5:30pm and it was busy and fairly loud but still had a few empty tables so we didn't have to wait. Dad got the Standard, mom got the Cider House Rules, and I went with the Chorizador Burger as a burger bowl with a friend egg on top. And then doughnuts to finish it off. Dad is extremely picky when it comes to burgers but he absolutely loved his. He got the R sauce on the side which was smart. He said the burger was cooked exactly how he likes it, a nice crunch from the subtle burnt outside and zero pink inside. He also loved their fries! Mom enjoyed hers as well. She couldn't taste the orange mint aioli with everything else going on but the chicken, bacon and brie was a winning combination.\n\nI opted for the burger bowl variation and it was actually really tasty! My patty was a mix of chorizo spiced pork and beef and although I was hoping for that distinct chorizo spiciness, it was fairly subdued, both the patty itself as well as the diablo sauce. So this burger was not spicy and can be enjoyed by anyone, even if you have sensitive taste buds. I thought the burger bowl concept worked, even if the thick cut of iceberg lettuce as the base was awkward to cut into. I ended up pushing my patty/fried egg off the top and cut up the lettuce until it resembled more of a salad, but the diablo sauce that had blanketed most of the lettuce worked great as a kind of dressing and was really good! The sides of black beans/yams/corn/hard boiled egg/avocado/tomato slices were fresh and quite filling when combined with the burger. So if you're looking for an alternative to fries, I'd definitely recommend that!\n\nBut the highlight of this meal were those incredible doughnuts! They're served pipping hot, almost too hot to eat right away but the sugary glaze on top mingling with the dipping sauces (caramel and chocolate I believe) just made them melt in my mouth in the most delicious and satisfying way. I cannot stress enough how good those little doughnuts are! Get em!\n\nWe had a great experience here. Our waiter was really friendly.

Live violin music by the talented James Mahler. Sparkling bar, nice outside patio. Counter service only, order, pay, take a number, and your good will be delivered. Sarah was the one who took our order; uber friendly and helpful! Self-serve coffee & Maine Root fountain drinks (despite the name, a local company). Chef Bryan came around to the tables, something I always appreciate. \n\n*BBQ Pulled Pork Benedict is interestingly served on cornmeal cakes rather than English muffins. Nice spicy tangy flavor profile, but overall not very wholesome. \n\n*Hideaway Griddle Cakes (Tall Stack, add Blueberry) Omigod these were delicious! Look how thick those are! Melt in your mouth with those blueberries. Not possible to order the short stack. Unless it is like three short stacks. \n\n*Hideaway Burger (Medium Rare, add Avocado, add fries) was good. Slightly dry, but only on the edges. Bun was tasty. Fries are diced potatoes. Were fine. \n\n*Chicken & Waffle? The best damn thing here. And Chef Bryan agrees. Those chicken tenders are juicy and tender. The thin breading was the perfect amount. But that pickle brine must be the secret ingredient. Yum. Ask for some house ranch. Not that the delish meat needs it. The waffles were fresh. Unlike most waffles in Chicken & Waffles I have had, they actually saved well, still moist and sweet hours later! \n\nConclusion?

I love the option to sit at the bar if you've got a small party (1-2) where it's first come first serve. It's our go-to spot when we're craving Japanese beer, which they have on tap! My favorite is the spicy chicken ramen, which I get at the spiciest level - good heat, nice veggies, some umami flavor, thin noodles. We've had a number of the appetizers here as well, standouts being the brussel sprouts and crispy chicken. They've also got great combos, where you can add on things like crispy chicken + salad to a ramen order, which my fiance and I will often split as some food to go with our beers. \n\nMy only real complaint is the service, which leaves something to be desired. We'll often have to ask for things twice, or go hunt down waiters to ask for more water, napkins, etc. Once, we ordered drinks, and only got it after we waited 20 minutes for our food.

The pulpo was cooked very tenderly which my boyfriend liked, but I like my octopus a little chewier. The chocolate for the churros could've been a little thicker. My boyfriend thought the churros could've been smaller in thicker because he thought it should be crispier. Overall, good food :). PS our total was ~80 without tip.\n\nBoyfriend's opinion: The date bacon was a good mix of sweet and salty, texture was different, but the date was a little strong. Tartare was good, fresh, yolk was a good touch. The duck was rich but a little oily. Potato bravas was good aioli was nice, good crispiness. Octopus had good texture, but sauce could've been better. And the churros were ok, choco sauce couldve been better. Beet salad was good, strong flavors, the cheese clashed with it a bit.

The risotto was made with plain, white rice, seemingly cooked in water, not a vegetable broth, and served over a bland squash puree.  Mild chunks of apple were mixed in the rice.  Most uninteresting, and my wife left most of the dish uneaten.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the bread, possibly Iggy's, which we all ate as the meal mainstay.  One of us asked for butter, which was served as patties wrapped in foil.  \n\nThe cost of the meal was excessive.  The service was good, friendly, but not overly so.

We ordered our slices and a salad and sat down to wait. The place has a hodgepodge of plates and silverware that don't match anything but adds to the restaurants casual, hippy vibe. Again being from out of town we weren't as use to interacting with people who enjoyed the legalization of marijuana (or maybe she just has a whimsical personality), so it was funny when the waitress serving us remarked that I was given her favorite fork in the entire restaurant. She was a sweet heart. The place wasn't very busy and when the CD stopped pumping music she asked if we had any requests. I'm sure she would have found anything we requested to make us happy. \n  The pizza was great! We had the vegan veggie slice and a pepperoni and mushroom. The pepperoni was greasy but that's the nature of the beast, true to the New York style! Overall the pricing is a good value for great food. The environment was clean and eclectic. The staff was really friendly and helped us relax and have some fun after my aggressive sightseeing schedule!

So finally at 10:15pm we get seated as they were still arranging the tables when we were walking to our table where we had to stand for a few mins till they finish. We finally ordered and were told they were out of ribs which my husband wanted.. so we both ordered filet mignon, I ask the waiter twice please make sure that our steaks are well done he said no problem. So while waiting for our food we hear commotion and there was a fight that broke out at the bar with some women... another red flag I was definitely ready to go at this point, but hubby was like he wanted to stay cause he was so hungry so I agreed to stay. Our food finally came out at 11pm and it was still really red in the middle when i asked twice for well done so at this point I said enough.. we informed the waiter we didnt want it and just give us the bill for our drinks...the manager came over trying to plead with us but it was a no for me....

Problem #2 they have a \"\"vip\"\" area which people rent out but the only thing saying it's the vip area is a small sign which we completely missed as it it was our first time there so we enter since it looked pretty cool and we are immediately thrown out of the area with an EXTREMELY RUDE ATTITUDE.

This place is definitely for a younger crowd who doesn't mind cramped seating, bad parking options, and a loud atmosphere. Coming here with friends is a great time, coming here with your parents is not. Regardless of which location you pick you can expect to drive around searching for parking and waiting to be seated unless you go during the off times. When I came to the Clintonville location I found it particularly hard to find parking because of where it's located in the strip. I highly recommend walking or using ride share to get there so you don't have to worry about the parking situation. In addition, I wouldn't say Condado's is a great place if you're looking for something that's handicap accessible. It is pretty tricky to maneuver in the restaurant since there are so many people and tables are fairly close together, but I'm sure if you mention it they would try to seat you closer to the front! \n\nWith that being said Condado's is an awesome place to come for tacos, margs on the rocks, and plenty of chips and dip (not free, you do have to pay!)! When I come here I love to build my own tacos and always opt for the Sweet Lucy shell (flour tortilla, corn tortilla, queso and guac layered together) as a base for my creations. I'm a huge fan of the braised beef brisket as well as the pulled pork for the filling, but also enjoy some of their excellent vegetarian options such as the Thai chili tofu. To change things up pair the brisket with the pineapple salsa, queso fresco, and the chipotle honey sauce! Yum. If you're not feeling creative they've got you covered with a set menu of tacos you can order from. I will also say the tacos are fairly large. If you're ordering chips and dip I suggest only getting 2 tacos as you'll fill up quicker than expected. \n\nAll in all once you make it inside it's a nice relaxing joint to chill out with some friends and enjoy some delicious food.

I suspect it's amazing if you're eating all the cheesy and meaty stuff, but the other options are a hard BLECTHhhhtttthhhh. I'm NOT vegan, but I can't eat dairy and I'm trying to eat less meat. I wanted to try all the things and figured they'd make good leftovers, so I got the pate trio, the eggplant walnut-pate roll-up dealies, the smoked-bean stuffed-dough doohickey, the mushroom dumpling jobbers, and a side of the red pepper stuff (I don't recall the proper names of anything, sry). \n\nThe beet pate legit tasted moldy (don't ask me how I know what mold tastes like..?), the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on, and the spinach pate would've been good if it wasn't so salty. The eggplant walnut-pate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own.. it was basically just a mouthful of pate. The smoked-bean dough thing was SOooooooo effing salty.. and I'm not one to shy away from salt. I couldn't even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt, but it def could've used the extra flavor otherwise. The mushroom dumplings looked so good, and I LOVE all things mushroom (and dumpling!), but these were all mushroom and nothing else.. the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with. These just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a Friday night cuz they weren't invited to the onion and herb party at the Savory's.. They even got all dolled up in their dough dress and put on their best cracked pepper.. It was a pretty sad day in dumpling town..\n\nAll in all, my experience was pretty shMEHhhhh. I'd avoid this place if you're vegan or dairy-free. Im sure that puddle of cheesy eggy butter bread is orgasmic, and maybe the meat dishes are worth eating, but everything I ordered was really disappointing.. Although, the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty. Heavy on the fenugreek tho, which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it. The pita-like bread that came with the pate trio was good too, so if I eat there again (unlikely) I'll get the bread with a side of fenugreek-sweat surprise, and maybe I'll try the meat dumplings.. \n\nHopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they don't make any more super salty or moldy-tasting mistakes!\"</td><td>i really wanted to love this place i suspect its amazing if you are eating all the cheesy and meaty stuff but the other options are a hard blecthhhhtttthhhh I am not vegan but i cannot eat dairy and I am trying to eat less meat i wanted to try all the things and figured they would make good leftovers so i got the pate trio the eggplant walnutpate rollup dealies the smokedbean stuffeddough doohickey the mushroom dumpling jobbers and a side of the red pepper stuff i do not recall the proper names of anything sry the beet pate legit tasted moldy do not ask me how i know what mold tastes like the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on and the spinach pate would have been good if it was not so salty the eggplant walnutpate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own it was basically just a mouthful of pate the smokedbean dough thing was soooooooo effing salty and I am not one to shy away from salt i could not even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt but it def could have used the extra flavor otherwise the mushroom dumplings looked so good and i love all things mushroom and dumpling but these were all mushroom and nothing else the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with these just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a friday night cuz they were not invited to the onion and herb party at the savorys they even got all dolled up in their dough dress and put on their best cracked pepper it was a pretty sad day in dumpling town all in all my experience was pretty shmehhhhh id avoid this place if you are vegan or dairyfree I am sure that puddle of cheesy eggy butter bread is orgasmic and maybe the meat dishes are worth eating but everything i ordered was really disappointing although the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty heavy on the fenugreek tho which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it the pitalike bread that came with the pate trio was good too so if i eat there again unlikely ill get the bread with a side of fenugreeksweat surprise and maybe ill try the meat dumplings hopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they do not make any more super salty or moldytasting mistakes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>eY3-ZE8-njGOglACqFYqVQ</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-11</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5.0</td><td>LaBottega is our family's favorite restaurant in Vancouver!

One thing that was in plain sight from the front counter was the grey metal mousetrap in the back room to the right of their entry door - again clearly visible from the customer counter, very appetizing, and gave me time to think about why it was there in that kitchen.\n\nFinally, someone came through the entry door (delivery guy back from his run) and he asked if I had been helped.  He then got ahold of the woman who was in the far back of the building, no clue what she was doing...but nothing pizza-making related.

We were able to get seated immediately though.\n\nThe restaurant has a great list of cocktails and alcoholic beverages (including happy hour!) which you don't find at most Indian restaurants. It's definitely a more upscale vibe.\n\nThe happy hour is a great deal. It runs Monday to Saturday 3-6 and 10 to close, as well as all day Sunday.

It's well flavored and moist. My friend didn't think it was spicy but I had a little trouble with it, since I'm extremely sensitive to spicy food.\n\nThe yellow daal fry ($12) was also really spicy. I couldn't eat more than a spoonful, which is unfortunate because it tasted delicious.

Luckily this time it was actually mild. It was much sweeter than expected but not spicy at all, so I could actually eat it. They were generous with the fish chunks too. This was the first fish curry I've ever tried at an Indian restaurant but I'm very impressed.\n\nMy friend ordered the kadahi paneer ($14) and really enjoyed that too.

I'm generally quite introverted and am perfectly happy sitting on my couch, watching movies and shows, drinking red wine and coffee (sometimes one right after the other). I get especially excited for winter storms because I KNOW that nobody will dare ask me to go anywhere.\nWell, my friends and partner all wanted to go out for dinner as the first winter storm of 2019 was beginning. I really thought I could get out of it by telling them that I'm enjoying my weekend INDOORS. And by continuously telling them about the forecast. There was no winning with these extroverted people, so I ended up Orinoco.\nWell, I really had no regrets afterwards. I was actually HAPPY and GRATEFUL to them that we went out. There were very few people in the restaurant because of the snow, so we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves.\nPros: fun ambience and decor; GREAT food (I especially recommend the seared tuna, arepas, and empanadas)\nCon: the sangria tasted REALLY good, but it really doesn't feel like an alcoholic beverage. So, if you're looking to get buzzed... or tipsy... or drunk, the sangria won't do it for you. Thankfully, I don't like the taste of alcohol so the sangria served as just an awesome beverage that went well with my food.\nWill I return here? Absolutely. And I'll probably eat everything that I ate this past time!\"</td><td>one of my favorite things about the winter time is the decreased pressure to go out or at least that is how i perceive it I am generally quite introverted and am perfectly happy sitting on my couch watching movies and shows drinking red wine and coffee sometimes one right after the other i get especially excited for winter storms because i know that nobody will dare ask me to go anywhere well my friends and partner all wanted to go out for dinner as the first winter storm of was beginning i really thought i could get out of it by telling them that I am enjoying my weekend indoors and by continuously telling them about the forecast there was no winning with these extroverted people so i ended up orinoco well i really had no regrets afterwards i was actually happy and grateful to them that we went out there were very few people in the restaurant because of the snow so we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves pros fun ambience and decor great food i especially recommend the seared tuna arepas and empanadas con the sangria tasted really good but it really does not feel like an alcoholic beverage so if you are looking to get buzzed or tipsy or drunk the sangria will not do it for you thankfully i do not like the taste of alcohol so the sangria served as just an awesome beverage that went well with my food will i return here absolutely and ill probably eat everything that i ate this past time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>eNk05xdapvviSnPkvJAgHw</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-10</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>\"Please, for the love of all that is good do NOT eat here.

Again, the food is amazing and our waiter was excellent. My husband and I first dined at Hollerbach's around 10 months ago. The weather was nice but cool enough for me to wear a sweater. Once we were seated I took off my grey wrap around sweater and place it on the seat next to me. Unfortunately we left without my sweater. I called the restaurant later that day and was told they did not have it. I was advised to call back in a    couple of days which I did. Again I was told they did not have it. I tried again a week later and was told the same thing. No sweater. We dined at Hollerbach's again 6 months later and of course I asked about my sweater only to be told they did not have it. So today we decided to make the 90 minute trip to Sanford and visit our favorite German restaurant and upon our arrival (approximately 2:00 PM) both our jaws hit the floor. The hostess who was stationed outside was WEARING MY SWEATER. I immediately told her I liked her sweater and asked her where she got it. She appeared to be shocked so I told her that I had the same sweater and that I had left it behind at this very restaurant. She responded by telling me she got it at Target. This sweater was purchased at Dillard's in Ocala, FL and was not a Target product. In addition to that, this young lady was swimming in this sweater which was a size 3X. I did ask our waiter about the lost and found policy being that he was fairly new, he was unsure.

Myers & Chang was just what I needed the other night, and perhaps every night that I need to eat. What do I need? Why, a bunch of sizzling tasty Asian small plates! Always. The vegan options are plentiful, with things like spring rolls, noodle bowls, sautéed vegetables (like I can EVER resist bok choy?!) I think my eyes teared a bit looking at the menu, I swear. This is pretty much my favorite food on the planet.\n\nIt was a Friday night and people eat out on Friday nights, especially at 5 star places. The nicest lady at the host stand took my name and promised to text when a table was ready. And pay attention, because this is something that put this place over the top in the list of Joi B's favorite restaurants in the US (yes, Meyers & Chang, you're on it): when our table was ready 45 minutes later, we were at a cute pub right across the street, not minding a thing. The text informed us that our counter seats were ready. When I'm not dining alone, the last place in the world I want to sit is at a counter. Hell, even if I had been eating alone, I would have done so begrudgingly (and only if really hungry). So, I texted back and asked if it was OK if we waited a little longer for a table. The response was nothing short of wonderful. \"\"Sure, we can do that! It should be another half hour...\"\" Wow! I'm so used to high demand places acting like they are doing you a huge favor to seat you where you want (or NOT seat you where you don't want). It's just been my experience lately and I suppose I may have a chip on my shoulder about it. But this was such a breath of fresh air and will make me a forever customer.\n\nThe restaurant is loud and bustling, but it's a celebratory atmosphere, with people who are in love with their food. Can't beat that. Soon we were right there with them, as plate after plate arrived: the scallion pancakes (crispy/salty delicious), the BEST bok choy I've ever had, the so very transcendental tofu stirfry with slippery noodles (texture fest! And an extremely pleasing flavor) and crispy spring rolls that I devoured so quickly, they were barely even there.

Since the other more popular spots were either out of meat by this time (we went at night) or way too overrun (it was the day before SXSW started), one of my local friends suggested Terry Black's as it was his go-to BBQ place.\n\nFood: This was definitely some real damn food BBQ. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, and probably not the best Austin has to offer, but it is really good. Had a beef rib, smoked sausage, Mac, and their peach cobbler. The rib was HUGE! I didn't even get to finish it all because it was just too much. But damn was it nice. I think it could've been a bit more tender and juicy, but for the portion size it was still damn good, especially with their sauces on the table which I thought were fantastic. The sausage was good but nothing too special about it. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and creamy which I like, and being from Georgia, im a sucker for a good peach cobbler and theirs didn't disappoint!\n\nDrinks: I should title this beer, because it's beer galore! I tried something different which I didn't end up liking - should've gone for something lighter, but all in a they've got an incredible selection.\n\nAmbience: Typical BBQ spot with a casual yet still clean and polished vibe.\n\nPrice: This is where I had to dock them a star. The food was great don't get me wrong, but I thought it was way too overpriced.\n\nAll in all this'll definitely be a spot I'll try again when I'm in town, but there's definitely better places around if you manage to get lucky and catch them before they run out.\n\nSN: ***This Is My 100th Yelp Review!

I'm so glad I was able to get tofu in a cup. It's very silky and has syrup that's very flavourful! Pearls are incredibly chewy and different from any others I've had. It's more hearty if that makes sense and the pearls go well with the tofu! Highly recommend if you're a tofu fan or want something less drink and more filling!!\n\nPapaya fresh fruit with milk 9/10\nVery creamy and smooth. You could really taste the papaya! I wish the papaya was a little sweeter but makes sense it's not in season! It's a lot richer than most places and not watery at all! \n\nFresh fruit Lychee with pearls 9.5/10\nYummy with real lychee pieces. Very refreshing and not overly sweet which is surprising. The pearls go well with the lychee as you get to chew on both of them\n\nTried my friends milk tea and matcha ice cream half sugar!\nMilk tea is delicious as I think it's more Hong Kong style so you can really taste the tea!

Mix of 5 smoked Asian teas if I heard my waitress correctly. Interesting in that they mix the house made jam.  It's not for me though.  But either the sugar cubes, works for me = sweet tea.\n\nButerbrodi (open face rye bread sandwich):  \nGarlic sausage and pickles-sweet pickle and sausage had solid flavor.  Not a fan of the rye though as it was too delicate.\nGarlic cheese: not bad.  The garlic spread comes with shredded cheese, giving it a nice texture.\nSmoked herring schmear: reminds me of smoked salmon.  Good fish that wasn't overpowering.  Good one.\n\nKhachapuri: consists of Georgian cheese bread and local honey.  Not what I was expecting as it is trying to be savory but the honey throws it off.\n\nStuffed egg with sumac: creamy stuffing. Egg cooked well.\n\nMushroom piroshki: very tasty.  The outside resembles the texture of a pretzel bun.  The mushroom were well flavored and chopped small.\n\nTraditional blini: comes with steelhead caviar and sour cream.  The caviar provides a nice sea flavor that complements the sour cream and soft pancake.\n\nWalnut stuffed eggplant roll:  not for me.  The crunch of the walnut, the mint, sunflower sesame oil (didn't notice) and pomegranate seed with the slippery eggplant roll was ok for me\n\nTort po kievski:  hazelnut meringue, coffee buttercream & chocolate ganache.  Great texture with a crispy element.  Too bad I'm not a fan of bitter or I would really like this\n\nLemon zest halva (crystallized sesame candy):  crumbly with sweetened sesame flavor.  Decent.\n\nRulet s makes: Ukrainian poppyseed roll.\n\nSteopka: grandmas sour cream and walnut cake.  Not too sweet. Decent flavor.\n\nMedovik tort: honey cake, graham dust & light cream. Good flavor and not too sweet. IMO better than steopka.\n\nZapekanka: Russian cheesecake with lemon zest.  Light and not too sweet.

The room was modern and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were numerous and soft, yet supportive. It was the perfect size for the two of us, but I could see how a family of four might struggle to find a spot for all of their luggage with the pull down bed open. The aesthetics were fantastic! Each section of the property really reflected the decade it was representing and was truly a lot of fun to walk through and look at. \n\nThe food court had plenty of options. Admittedly, we didn't eat there often, but the food options seemed very kid friendly as there was something for even the pickiest eaters. The prices were in-line with what you would expect from a Disney resort. The pizza slices were huge, as they're basically 1/4 of an entire pizza so the $9 price tag isn't the worst thing in the world. The one \"\"flaw\"\" would be that the free mugs you get for staying at the resort don't have any signs suggesting they are free with your stay. This seemed like a \"\"gotcha\"\" moment for a lot families who aren't informed. \n\nThe buses to the parks and Disney Springs are well laid out and easy to find. The bus schedules are posted throughout the front of the property so it was easy to plan what time you needed to be ready at the bus queue. It's also helpful that the app has the bus schedule as well to make planning easier. Pop Century has its own buses to and from the parks and doesn't make any stops like some of the All-Star resorts do, which is a nice bonus.

In between the food seemed to come out very slowly with the exception of our entrees. \n\nFOOD / BEVERAGE\nThis was really where the meal fell short for us. For appetizers we tried their tomato bisque and the brie plate. The tomato bisque was OK but not what I would typically expect from a bisque. The brie plate was WAY too sweet. It really needed something salty, savory, or spicy to balance out ALL the sweet things on the plate -- apples, strawberries, marmalade, honey. For the entree we got the sesame orange glazed salmon and the chicken saltimbocca. The salmon on its own was good, as was the broccolini that came with it, but the sauce was WAY too salty and the rice was under-seasoned. The chicken had a weird quality that made it look reheated which was not appealing. It lacked flavor and the sauce was not particularly great. The au gratin potatoes were a crowd favorite. For dessert we both got the apple crisp and it was truly the highlight of the meal. Absolutely perfect. \n\nRESTROOMS\nCute single stall restroom.

I came in with high hopes of eating some delicious food based on the pictures but left hungry and unsatisfied as a result of poor table service. \nThe restaurant only does walk ins for parties smaller than a size of 8. We came in on a Friday evening and were seated right away by a lovely hostess( one star is for the hostess)\nThe best part of the menu is that it has several vegan/ vegetarian options which is great when outing with friends who only follow a vegan/vegetarian/ gluten free diet. \nThe main reason for our horrible experience was our server. Despite it not being too busy he would disappear for lengths of time. From seating to ordering it was about 45 mins. \nWe orders a round of appetizers(3 dishes) and entrees(3 dishes). Again, the wait from ordering to having a meal on the table was about an hour. BUT....we were only served our entrees! Our server looked confused when we inquired about the appetizer round and returned to let us know that he had forgotten to enter the order entirely!\nFor our main course we got burgers and butternut squash lasagna. I got the Cajun burger with sweet potato fries. It was good nothing to write home about(2nd star). The sweet potato fries were soggy. My friend who got the lasgna(a special) enjoyed her meal. The third person on our table also got a burger without a bun but the meal came with the bun!\nThrough our time there we noticed confused runners with regards to which food went to what table. We had a wrong order brought to us twice. It highlights that there seems to be no communication at all between the front and back of the house... this not on a busy night. I dread to think what chaos a busy evening would bring. \nWe were offered no compensation for the fact that 3 of the dishes we ordered didn't make the table.

The truffle Mac & cheese is tasty, might be a little heavy for some but it's worth the up-charge. Sadly, that about ends the positives from this visit. They managed to have one table member's order come out wrong twice and service just wasn't good. The restaurant was, if I'm generous, maybe half full and I just can't figure out why we then watched another table that came in and ordered after ours (we were both 4 tops) have their drinks refilled twice before ours came out. The Bloody Sally/Mary I ordered took the entire meal to arrive (in fairness I ordered when the food was delivered) but at no point was there any acknowledgement by staff that our drinks had taken so long (11min wait for a Bloody in a basically empty restaurant). The Bloody was hopefully a fluke and it's normally good but it tasted like straight up shrimp cocktail sauce. I like a spicy or even unique take on a Bloody Mary but this isn't it - whatever their 'made from scratch' recipe is needs a rework.</td><td>food was good not much else i grabbed the what the cluck which i think has a good balance of sweet and savory with just a little spice so id definitely recommend that the truffle mac cheese is tasty might be a little heavy for some but its worth the upcharge sadly that about ends the positives from this visit they managed to have one table members order come out wrong twice and service just was not good the restaurant was if I am generous maybe half full and i just cannot figure out why we then watched another table that came in and ordered after ours we were both tops have their drinks refilled twice before ours came out the bloody sallymary i ordered took the entire meal to arrive in fairness i ordered when the food was delivered but at no point was there any acknowledgement by staff that our drinks had taken so long min wait for a bloody in a basically empty restaurant the bloody was hopefully a fluke and its normally good but it tasted like straight up shrimp cocktail sauce i like a spicy or even unique take on a bloody mary but this is not it whatever their made from scratch recipe is needs a rework</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>XqNgfxyXP3kz8t3iG8ehZA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-18</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"This is my new favorite vegan spot.

I've heard many great things about this place and its chicken and thought it'd be a great place to catch up with old friends.\n\nWe came in yesterday around 6:30p or so, about an hour after opening. It looked like a slow night and we were seated promptly. We were given water and silverware while we were waiting on another person. Things were looking good for this establishment so far.\nWhen the last member of our party arrived we were ready to order. One of my friends ordered 5 drumsticks. The waitress told us to hold on a second and hurried away. She came back to say they were out of drumsticks but had exactly 5 left for my friend. That was interesting... We continued ordering.\nOne of my friends ordered 5 chicken tenders with sauce on the side and no fries. Another friend ordered a pint of Bluemoon and some dumplings. My other friend ordered the kimchi fries with just regular cut fries.\nI wanted to order the drumsticks, but since they suddenly ran out, I tried to order the wings. The waitress told me they ran out of wings without checking, so I settled for the tenders and a side of waffle fries. I felt a little disappointed since I was eager to try their drumsticks, not the tenders.\nOur food came out and there were mix ups. I didn't get my side of fries and my other friend who ordered the tenders got the fries instead. My friend who ordered the kimchi fries with regular cut fries received waffle fries. It was probably just a simple mistake. We didn't call the waitress over and just made do. It wasn't too big of a deal.\nThe food was good. I tried my friend's drumstick and it was great. The chicken tenders paled in comparison. They were decent, but they weren't anything special like the drumstick. The fries were crispy and satisfying. My friends enjoyed their food. But this is where the dining experience went downhill.\nWe asked for 5 separate checks. The waitress said sure, but came back after a few minutes. She said they were only allowed to split checks 4 ways, but that she was willing to split it 5 ways. We thanked her for being kind enough to do that and she walked away. However, when she came back the checks were very messed up.\nMy friend was charged for the fries he never ordered, my bill only charged me only for the tenders and not the fries, but my friend who ordered the dumplings and pint of beer was charged with an entree of chicken tenders that she never ordered.\nThe latter of the charges was alarming, so we called the waitress over. After much explaining, she finally took the charge for the entree of chicken tenders off. We paid, tipped, and were on our way.\n\nOverall, the experience was not great. I didn't understand how they could be out of drumsticks and wings after being open for an hour or so. It didn't make sense. It was a slow night. There were two, maybe three, other groups. For a place that's open until 1-2am, you would think they'd have enough chicken.....\nThe mix up with the food wasn't great, but tolerable. Mistakes happen. My friends and I were okay with it, but it dampened the experience.\n\nThe food was good. The drumsticks and fries tasted great, but the tenders were just decent. My friends and I enjoyed the food we received.\n\nHowever, the check mix up was just awful. How did my friend get charged for an entree she never ordered? Those mystery chicken tenders never made it to the table, but they certainly found their way onto my friend's bill.\n\nIn short, the food was pretty okay but the experience certainly left much to be desired. I'm not sure if the quality of food is worth the poor service. I don't know if I would consider coming back to this establishment after this first experience.\"</td><td>i never really write reviews but i feel like this place deserves it this was my first time at college roadhouse I have heard many great things about this place and its chicken and thought it would be a great place to catch up with old friends we came in yesterday around p or so about an hour after opening it looked like a slow night and we were seated promptly we were given water and silverware while we were waiting on another person things were looking good for this establishment so far when the last member of our party arrived we were ready to order one of my friends ordered drumsticks the waitress told us to hold on a second and hurried away she came back to say they were out of drumsticks but had exactly left for my friend that was interesting we continued ordering one of my friends ordered chicken tenders with sauce on the side and no fries another friend ordered a pint of bluemoon and some dumplings my other friend ordered the kimchi fries with just regular cut fries i wanted to order the drumsticks but since they suddenly ran out i tried to order the wings the waitress told me they ran out of wings without checking so i settled for the tenders and a side of waffle fries i felt a little disappointed since i was eager to try their drumsticks not the tenders our food came out and there were mix ups i did not get my side of fries and my other friend who ordered the tenders got the fries instead my friend who ordered the kimchi fries with regular cut fries received waffle fries it was probably just a simple mistake we did not call the waitress over and just made do it was not too big of a deal the food was good i tried my friends drumstick and it was great the chicken tenders paled in comparison they were decent but they were not anything special like the drumstick the fries were crispy and satisfying my friends enjoyed their food but this is where the dining experience went downhill we asked for separate checks the waitress said sure but came back after a few minutes she said they were only allowed to split checks ways but that she was willing to split it ways we thanked her for being kind enough to do that and she walked away however when she came back the checks were very messed up my friend was charged for the fries he never ordered my bill only charged me only for the tenders and not the fries but my friend who ordered the dumplings and pint of beer was charged with an entree of chicken tenders that she never ordered the latter of the charges was alarming so we called the waitress over after much explaining she finally took the charge for the entree of chicken tenders off we paid tipped and were on our way overall the experience was not great i did not understand how they could be out of drumsticks and wings after being open for an hour or so it did not make sense it was a slow night there were two maybe three other groups for a place that is open until am you would think they would have enough chicken the mix up with the food was not great but tolerable mistakes happen my friends and i were okay with it but it dampened the experience the food was good the drumsticks and fries tasted great but the tenders were just decent my friends and i enjoyed the food we received however the check mix up was just awful how did my friend get charged for an entree she never ordered those mystery chicken tenders never made it to the table but they certainly found their way onto my friends bill in short the food was pretty okay but the experience certainly left much to be desired I am not sure if the quality of food is worth the poor service i do not know if i would consider coming back to this establishment after this first experience</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>TU-MYM548DAVweH8Xa0OSA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-14</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5.0</td><td>I lived near the mall and this was my to go place at any time.

I can't measure the value against how long you'd wait in line as I went on a Wednesday evening with a short line.

Though it may not be on the level of Franklin's or la Barbecue, Terry Black's Barbecue is a premiere BBQ experience especially for a large place open for dinner. \n\nMeats:\nReally like the Brisket and Jalapeño cheese sausage.\nBeef ribs were a little dry despite having too much hardened fat layers. I did not try the pork ribs.\nAs others said, the brisket is salty so grab some complimentary white bread by the utensils area, which also offers free pickle slices and limes.

They had some really interesting flavours that most other ice-cream cafes don't have. I love how they offer ice-cream flights; 4 scoops for $12. That's what really intrigued me to come here, since I always have the hardest time choosing a flavour. The 4 flavours I chose were: HK Milk Tea, Raspberry White Chocolate Rose, Lychee Osmanthus and Viet Coffee.\n\nHK Milk Tea: 2/5 - I was really excited to try this flavour only to be disappointed. Probably because I'm used to more sweet milk teas, this had more of a tea taste. \n\nRaspberry White Chocolate Rose: 4/5 - I really enjoyed this flavour. I'm already a fan of Raspberry White Chocolate ice-cream but that added flavour of rose just made it even better! It was a settle rose taste the lingers after your take a bite, not too over powering. \n\nLychee Osmanthus: 5/5 - Now this flavour I loved!!!! It had a fruity and floral vibe to it which went really well together. Sometimes I find lychee flavoured things too sweet but I think the osmanthus helped cut that a bit and balanced it out really well. It has a very light flavour, it was really good. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try. \n\nViet Coffee: 3/5 - I'm not a big fan of coffee flavoured stuff but this one wasn't bad. It wasn't too bitter or too sweet. I liked how the coffee flavour wasn't too in your face.

The pernil sandwich was pretty good. Yuca fries had a great cilantro garlic sauce however it may have been a little too much. Maybe offer to have it on the side, some of the yuca were so drenched that the middle became soggy. Croquettas were ok, nothing to write home about. Cafe con leche was good, maybe a little too much milk for my liking. OJ was average, nothing special. Overall experience was average. I ended up getting my food before I got my drinks which was weird. I would have thought drinks would come first or at least offer water for your guests.

We also tried the Brussels sprouts and milk n cereal dessert, both of which were really special. Server was friendly but didn't seem knowledgeable about any of the fish.

I asked for fried dumplings and only the bottom portion was actually fried. I've been to other restaurants where they fry the whole thing so I was pretty thrown off by that, but that was okay. The waitress never came over to ask how everything was. Never refilled our water. Just put the food down wherever without making sure it was for the right person. So overall, we decided not to tip for a service where they literally put the food down and walked away. As we were leaving, the waitress comes after us saying \"\"no tip?\"\" and we respond \"\"no\"\". She didn't ask why or what she could do to improve and immediately went to get the manager. Now I don't know his name, but he was so rude. First it seemed like he was trying to understand why, but overall he was just trying to get us to pay a tip which the waitress did not deserve. Everything was explained to him and then he starts saying \"\"oh they shouldn't clean the tables or refill the water or take your orders\"\". This was just out right rude. Honestly I could have placed an order and picked it up from the kitchen myself and it would have been the same service.

We had made reservations and got seated immediately which was nice. The restaurant wasn't all that busy- then again, it was a Tuesday night. We sat down and a few people ordered the $5 mule. The waitress said they had run out of strawberry and passion fruit, so one friend ordered lime, and the other ordered cucumber. The waitress brought back 2 lime drinks. She corrected it once she found out. I ordered a clam chowder soup (it's described as being very popular at this restaurant) and a quinoa and avocado Powerbowl. My friend ordered a steak well done. My other friends ordered various things. I expected my soup to get to me before my food did, but I sat there in 45 minutes to an hour of hungry misery, and all my friends started getting antsy for their own food. I was about to tell the waitress to forget about the soup when she finally brought all the food to us. She told me she'd get me a spoon and be right back, but as I ate my powerbowl, I realized she must have forgotten, because 15 minutes went by with no spoon. Well I wasn't going to let my soup go cold, so I drank it like the orphan in Oliver Twist. The soup itself was very delicious, and I can see why it's popular. To quote Oliver Twist, \"\"Please sir, I want some more.\"\"\nHowever, the avocado and quinoa powerbowl was a bit disappointing. The dressing was nowhere to be found when you first look at it- I finally saw it at the bottom of the dish in small clumps on one side of the plate. My friend's steak was definitely not well done (more like medium). When he sent it back to be cooked more, he had to wait so long we were all done with our meals. He asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said well done steaks take longer than less cooked steaks. Well yes, obviously, except we just expected the chef to cook that same steak more thoroughly. I guess they had to heat up a whole new steak???\nEither way, my friends argued that they wanted the steak comped for the inconvenience, and then pointed out my missing spoon. The waitress sheepishly apologized. I feel her pain- I used to be a waitress. I understand the frustrations of forgetting something simple or being blamed for the steak that the kitchen can't seem to cook well. Girl, I know how you feel. \nNevertheless, I wouldn't go back here except maybe to try the brunch. Food took too long, meal was subpar...the only thing good was my cup of clam chowder.\"</td><td>i went to this restaurant for the first time with a group of friends we had made reservations and got seated immediately which was nice the restaurant was not all that busy then again it was a tuesday night we sat down and a few people ordered the mule the waitress said they had run out of strawberry and passion fruit so one friend ordered lime and the other ordered cucumber the waitress brought back lime drinks she corrected it once she found out i ordered a clam chowder soup its described as being very popular at this restaurant and a quinoa and avocado powerbowl my friend ordered a steak well done my other friends ordered various things i expected my soup to get to me before my food did but i sat there in minutes to an hour of hungry misery and all my friends started getting antsy for their own food i was about to tell the waitress to forget about the soup when she finally brought all the food to us she told me she would get me a spoon and be right back but as i ate my powerbowl i realized she must have forgotten because minutes went by with no spoon well i was not going to let my soup go cold so i drank it like the orphan in oliver twist the soup itself was very delicious and i can see why its popular to quote oliver twist please sir i want some more however the avocado and quinoa powerbowl was a bit disappointing the dressing was nowhere to be found when you first look at it i finally saw it at the bottom of the dish in small clumps on one side of the plate my friends steak was definitely not well done more like medium when he sent it back to be cooked more he had to wait so long we were all done with our meals he asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said well done steaks take longer than less cooked steaks well yes obviously except we just expected the chef to cook that same steak more thoroughly i guess they had to heat up a whole new steak either way my friends argued that they wanted the steak comped for the inconvenience and then pointed out my missing spoon the waitress sheepishly apologized i feel her pain i used to be a waitress i understand the frustrations of forgetting something simple or being blamed for the steak that the kitchen cannot seem to cook well girl i know how you feel nevertheless i would not go back here except maybe to try the brunch food took too long meal was subparthe only thing good was my cup of clam chowder</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>nqKL5PbJbwwoCK_Xon31kA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-16</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>4.0</td><td>Made our reservation online with no problem.

When you drop $250 for a meal for two, you expect amazing service and food from start to finish.  This was our first time here and asked for recommendations from our server.  She was not very descriptive nor help us at all with selling us into an amazing steak.  To start, the bread and butter they bring out to the table was plain with no flavor.  For a restaurant of this quality, this is cheap and unheard of.  We ordered the calamari to start.  It was cold and pretty tasteless for the price.  Had to ask for more chili sauce to give it some kick.  We ordered the dry age ribeye and the petite filet.  Both cooked to perfection with medium rare temperature.

The menu gives you quite a selection of appetizers and ramen bowls to choose from. We ordered the Shoyu Ramen & the AKA-Maru. Both were delicious. The noodles were chewy and the rich flavourful broth stood out to me the most. If you are someone who enjoys red onions and garnishes, you will likely enjoy their ramen as they add quite a bit into the soup. The soup base was also on the creamier side which I enjoyed. Prices are on the higher side of the spectrum but the taste was indeed unique. Also a +1 for them for being accommodating to dietary restrictions (removing ground chicken from the bowl)!

Even their roast chicken dish is delicious and anything but basic. But beyond the view and food, what is compelling me to write a review for the first time, is to acknowledge the awesome service! I've always had great service here, incredibly professional, courteous and knowledgeable and my recent dinner experience was no different. Darnae was so patient (we were at her table for three hours!) and receptive to our family who was visiting from NJ and celebrating an engagement and birthday. She was respectful giving us space and time to catch up and somehow read us perfectly appearing magically right as we needed her, water glasses always filled, and offering the best recommendations for our varied pallets.

When you stop here, you MUST order the doughnuts!!\n\nI ate here on a Saturday around 5:30pm and it was busy and fairly loud but still had a few empty tables so we didn't have to wait. Dad got the Standard, mom got the Cider House Rules, and I went with the Chorizador Burger as a burger bowl with a friend egg on top. And then doughnuts to finish it off. Dad is extremely picky when it comes to burgers but he absolutely loved his. He got the R sauce on the side which was smart. He said the burger was cooked exactly how he likes it, a nice crunch from the subtle burnt outside and zero pink inside. He also loved their fries! Mom enjoyed hers as well. She couldn't taste the orange mint aioli with everything else going on but the chicken, bacon and brie was a winning combination.\n\nI opted for the burger bowl variation and it was actually really tasty! My patty was a mix of chorizo spiced pork and beef and although I was hoping for that distinct chorizo spiciness, it was fairly subdued, both the patty itself as well as the diablo sauce. So this burger was not spicy and can be enjoyed by anyone, even if you have sensitive taste buds. I thought the burger bowl concept worked, even if the thick cut of iceberg lettuce as the base was awkward to cut into. I ended up pushing my patty/fried egg off the top and cut up the lettuce until it resembled more of a salad, but the diablo sauce that had blanketed most of the lettuce worked great as a kind of dressing and was really good! The sides of black beans/yams/corn/hard boiled egg/avocado/tomato slices were fresh and quite filling when combined with the burger. So if you're looking for an alternative to fries, I'd definitely recommend that!\n\nBut the highlight of this meal were those incredible doughnuts! They're served pipping hot, almost too hot to eat right away but the sugary glaze on top mingling with the dipping sauces (caramel and chocolate I believe) just made them melt in my mouth in the most delicious and satisfying way. I cannot stress enough how good those little doughnuts are! Get em!\n\nWe had a great experience here. Our waiter was really friendly.

Sarah was the one who took our order; uber friendly and helpful! Self-serve coffee & Maine Root fountain drinks (despite the name, a local company). Chef Bryan came around to the tables, something I always appreciate. \n\n*BBQ Pulled Pork Benedict is interestingly served on cornmeal cakes rather than English muffins. Nice spicy tangy flavor profile, but overall not very wholesome. \n\n*Hideaway Griddle Cakes (Tall Stack, add Blueberry) Omigod these were delicious! Look how thick those are! Melt in your mouth with those blueberries. Not possible to order the short stack. Unless it is like three short stacks. \n\n*Hideaway Burger (Medium Rare, add Avocado, add fries) was good. Slightly dry, but only on the edges. Bun was tasty. Fries are diced potatoes. Were fine. \n\n*Chicken & Waffle? The best damn thing here. And Chef Bryan agrees. Those chicken tenders are juicy and tender. The thin breading was the perfect amount. But that pickle brine must be the secret ingredient. Yum. Ask for some house ranch. Not that the delish meat needs it. The waffles were fresh. Unlike most waffles in Chicken & Waffles I have had, they actually saved well, still moist and sweet hours later! \n\nConclusion? They definitely have the ambiance down. 2 out of 4 dishes is not super, but they were surefire winners.
