Four of us ate at Metropolis Café last night, and the meal was the second poorest I have had in fifty years.  Rarely do I write a poor restaurant review, but the meal last night was so bad, I felt I had write this. \n\nTwo of us had the meager cider-braised short rib, which was dry, stringy and tough.  The meat was served on a bed of a tepid, tasteless white puree, said to be potato - perhaps made from a box product.  The two were surrounded by a thin, tasteless brown liquid.  The puree was topped by two ostensibly roasted carrots.  One was partially cooked, raw in the center and the second could not have been in an oven for more than a few minutes.  Neither had been roasted with any meat juice, butter and anything that could provide flavor.  There was no seasoning to be tasted.\n\nMy wife had the squash and apple non-risotto \"\"risotto\"\".  The risotto was made with plain, white rice, seemingly cooked in water, not a vegetable broth, and served over a bland squash puree.  Mild chunks of apple were mixed in the rice.  Most uninteresting, and my wife left most of the dish uneaten.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the bread, possibly Iggy's, which we all ate as the meal mainstay.  One of us asked for butter, which was served as patties wrapped in foil.  \n\nThe cost of the meal was excessive.  The service was good, friendly, but not overly so.

There's barely any tables despite how large this place is. Most of it is empty space and during times where it is too crowded, this is largely inconvenient for customers.

This place is definitely for a younger crowd who doesn't mind cramped seating, bad parking options, and a loud atmosphere. Coming here with friends is a great time, coming here with your parents is not. Regardless of which location you pick you can expect to drive around searching for parking and waiting to be seated unless you go during the off times. When I came to the Clintonville location I found it particularly hard to find parking because of where it's located in the strip. I highly recommend walking or using ride share to get there so you don't have to worry about the parking situation. In addition, I wouldn't say Condado's is a great place if you're looking for something that's handicap accessible. It is pretty tricky to maneuver in the restaurant since there are so many people and tables are fairly close together, but I'm sure if you mention it they would try to seat you closer to the front! \n\nWith that being said Condado's is an awesome place to come for tacos, margs on the rocks, and plenty of chips and dip (not free, you do have to pay!)! When I come here I love to build my own tacos and always opt for the Sweet Lucy shell (flour tortilla, corn tortilla, queso and guac layered together) as a base for my creations. I'm a huge fan of the braised beef brisket as well as the pulled pork for the filling, but also enjoy some of their excellent vegetarian options such as the Thai chili tofu. To change things up pair the brisket with the pineapple salsa, queso fresco, and the chipotle honey sauce! Yum. If you're not feeling creative they've got you covered with a set menu of tacos you can order from. I will also say the tacos are fairly large. If you're ordering chips and dip I suggest only getting 2 tacos as you'll fill up quicker than expected. \n\nAll in all once you make it inside it's a nice relaxing joint to chill out with some friends and enjoy some delicious food.

I suspect it's amazing if you're eating all the cheesy and meaty stuff, but the other options are a hard BLECTHhhhtttthhhh. I'm NOT vegan, but I can't eat dairy and I'm trying to eat less meat. I wanted to try all the things and figured they'd make good leftovers, so I got the pate trio, the eggplant walnut-pate roll-up dealies, the smoked-bean stuffed-dough doohickey, the mushroom dumpling jobbers, and a side of the red pepper stuff (I don't recall the proper names of anything, sry). \n\nThe beet pate legit tasted moldy (don't ask me how I know what mold tastes like..?), the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on, and the spinach pate would've been good if it wasn't so salty. The eggplant walnut-pate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own.. it was basically just a mouthful of pate. The smoked-bean dough thing was SOooooooo effing salty.. and I'm not one to shy away from salt. I couldn't even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt, but it def could've used the extra flavor otherwise. The mushroom dumplings looked so good, and I LOVE all things mushroom (and dumpling!), but these were all mushroom and nothing else.. the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with. These just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a Friday night cuz they weren't invited to the onion and herb party at the Savory's.. They even got all dolled up in their dough dress and put on their best cracked pepper.. It was a pretty sad day in dumpling town..\n\nAll in all, my experience was pretty shMEHhhhh. I'd avoid this place if you're vegan or dairy-free. Im sure that puddle of cheesy eggy butter bread is orgasmic, and maybe the meat dishes are worth eating, but everything I ordered was really disappointing.. Although, the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty. Heavy on the fenugreek tho, which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it. The pita-like bread that came with the pate trio was good too, so if I eat there again (unlikely) I'll get the bread with a side of fenugreek-sweat surprise, and maybe I'll try the meat dumplings.. \n\nHopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they don't make any more super salty or moldy-tasting mistakes!\"","i really wanted to love this place i suspect its amazing if you are eating all the cheesy and meaty stuff but the other options are a hard blecthhhhtttthhhh I am not vegan but i cannot eat dairy and I am trying to eat less meat i wanted to try all the things and figured they would make good leftovers so i got the pate trio the eggplant walnutpate rollup dealies the smokedbean stuffeddough doohickey the mushroom dumpling jobbers and a side of the red pepper stuff i do not recall the proper names of anything sry the beet pate legit tasted moldy do not ask me how i know what mold tastes like the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on and the spinach pate would have been good if it was not so salty the eggplant walnutpate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own it was basically just a mouthful of pate the smokedbean dough thing was soooooooo effing salty and I am not one to shy away from salt i could not even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt but it def could have used the extra flavor otherwise the mushroom dumplings looked so good and i love all things mushroom and dumpling but these were all mushroom and nothing else the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with these just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a friday night cuz they were not invited to the onion and herb party at the savorys they even got all dolled up in their dough dress and put on their best cracked pepper it was a pretty sad day in dumpling town all in all my experience was pretty shmehhhhh id avoid this place if you are vegan or dairyfree I am sure that puddle of cheesy eggy butter bread is orgasmic and maybe the meat dishes are worth eating but everything i ordered was really disappointing although the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty heavy on the fenugreek tho which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it the pitalike bread that came with the pate trio was good too so if i eat there again unlikely ill get the bread with a side of fenugreeksweat surprise and maybe ill try the meat dumplings hopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they do not make any more super salty or moldytasting mistakes","really wanted love place suspect amazing eating cheesy meaty stuff option hard blecthhhhtttthhhh I vegan eat dairy I trying eat le meat wanted try thing figured would make good leftover got pate trio eggplant walnutpate rollup dealies smokedbean stuffeddough doohickey mushroom dumpling jobber side red pepper stuff recall proper name anything sorry beet pate legit tasted moldy ask know mold taste like carrot version cardboard flavor going spinach pate would good wa salty eggplant walnutpate dealies pretty bitter seemed rich eaten wa basically mouthful pate smokedbean dough thing wa soooooooo effing salty I one shy away salt could even put red pepper stuff cause added salt definitely could used extra flavor otherwise mushroom dumpling looked good love thing mushroom dumpling mushroom nothing else beauty mushroom take flavor whatever else cook tasted like lonely old mushroom home alone friday night cause invited onion herb party savory even got dolled dough dress put best cracked pepper wa pretty sad day dumpling town experience wa pretty shmehhhhh identification avoid place vegan dairyfree I sure puddle cheesy eggy butter bread orgasmic maybe meat dish worth eating everything ordered wa really disappointing although side red pepper spread wa pretty tasty heavy fenugreek though one spice sweat day eat pitalike bread came pate trio wa good eat unlikely ill get bread side fenugreeksweat surprise maybe ill try meat dumpling hopefully people ( ) start tasting food serve make super salty moldytasting mistake",1],["eY3-ZE8-njGOglACqFYqVQ",0,"2019-01-11",0,1,5.0,"LaBottega is our family's favorite restaurant in Vancouver!

We were able to get seated immediately though.\n\nThe restaurant has a great list of cocktails and alcoholic beverages (including happy hour!) which you don't find at most Indian restaurants. It's definitely a more upscale vibe.\n\nThe happy hour is a great deal. It runs Monday to Saturday 3-6 and 10 to close, as well as all day Sunday. There are daily drink specials (Thursday's was $2 off margaritas) as well small bites. I got the margarita as it was the special that day, and surprisingly it was pretty good. I'm picky with my margaritas and thought theirs was the best one I've had in a couple months.

It's well flavored and moist. My friend didn't think it was spicy but I had a little trouble with it, since I'm extremely sensitive to spicy food.\n\nThe yellow daal fry ($12) was also really spicy. I couldn't eat more than a spoonful, which is unfortunate because it tasted delicious. We had asked them to make it mild so I'm guessing this is their version of mild...again my friend didn't think it was spicy but I really struggled with it.\n\nFor my main, I went with the fish curry ($16) and requested mild. Luckily this time it was actually mild. It was much sweeter than expected but not spicy at all, so I could actually eat it. They were generous with the fish chunks too. This was the first fish curry I've ever tried at an Indian restaurant but I'm very impressed.\n\nMy friend ordered the kadahi paneer ($14) and really enjoyed that too.

Again, the food is amazing and our waiter was excellent. My husband and I first dined at Hollerbach's around 10 months ago. The weather was nice but cool enough for me to wear a sweater. Once we were seated I took off my grey wrap around sweater and place it on the seat next to me. Unfortunately we left without my sweater. I called the restaurant later that day and was told they did not have it. I was advised to call back in a    couple of days which I did. Again I was told they did not have it. I tried again a week later and was told the same thing. No sweater. We dined at Hollerbach's again 6 months later and of course I asked about my sweater only to be told they did not have it. So today we decided to make the 90 minute trip to Sanford and visit our favorite German restaurant and upon our arrival (approximately 2:00 PM) both our jaws hit the floor. The hostess who was stationed outside was WEARING MY SWEATER. I immediately told her I liked her sweater and asked her where she got it. She appeared to be shocked so I told her that I had the same sweater and that I had left it behind at this very restaurant. She responded by telling me she got it at Target. This sweater was purchased at Dillard's in Ocala, FL and was not a Target product. In addition to that, this young lady was swimming in this sweater which was a size 3X. I did ask our waiter about the lost and found policy being that he was fairly new, he was unsure. He did offer to get a manager, however, we declined since it's just going to be her word against mine. I don't know what angers me more....her lying to my face or being lied to by staff 10 months ago.

The text informed us that our counter seats were ready. When I'm not dining alone, the last place in the world I want to sit is at a counter. Hell, even if I had been eating alone, I would have done so begrudgingly (and only if really hungry). So, I texted back and asked if it was OK if we waited a little longer for a table. The response was nothing short of wonderful. \"\"Sure, we can do that! It should be another half hour...\"\" Wow! I'm so used to high demand places acting like they are doing you a huge favor to seat you where you want (or NOT seat you where you don't want). It's just been my experience lately and I suppose I may have a chip on my shoulder about it. But this was such a breath of fresh air and will make me a forever customer.\n\nThe restaurant is loud and bustling, but it's a celebratory atmosphere, with people who are in love with their food. Can't beat that. Soon we were right there with them, as plate after plate arrived: the scallion pancakes (crispy/salty delicious), the BEST bok choy I've ever had, the so very transcendental tofu stirfry with slippery noodles (texture fest! And an extremely pleasing flavor) and crispy spring rolls that I devoured so quickly, they were barely even there.

I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, and probably not the best Austin has to offer, but it is really good. Had a beef rib, smoked sausage, Mac, and their peach cobbler. The rib was HUGE! I didn't even get to finish it all because it was just too much. But damn was it nice. I think it could've been a bit more tender and juicy, but for the portion size it was still damn good, especially with their sauces on the table which I thought were fantastic. The sausage was good but nothing too special about it. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and creamy which I like, and being from Georgia, im a sucker for a good peach cobbler and theirs didn't disappoint!\n\nDrinks: I should title this beer, because it's beer galore! I tried something different which I didn't end up liking - should've gone for something lighter, but all in a they've got an incredible selection.\n\nAmbience: Typical BBQ spot with a casual yet still clean and polished vibe.\n\nPrice: This is where I had to dock them a star.

The room was modern and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were numerous and soft, yet supportive. It was the perfect size for the two of us, but I could see how a family of four might struggle to find a spot for all of their luggage with the pull down bed open. The aesthetics were fantastic! Each section of the property really reflected the decade it was representing and was truly a lot of fun to walk through and look at. \n\nThe food court had plenty of options. Admittedly, we didn't eat there often, but the food options seemed very kid friendly as there was something for even the pickiest eaters. The prices were in-line with what you would expect from a Disney resort. The pizza slices were huge, as they're basically 1/4 of an entire pizza so the $9 price tag isn't the worst thing in the world. The one \"\"flaw\"\" would be that the free mugs you get for staying at the resort don't have any signs suggesting they are free with your stay. This seemed like a \"\"gotcha\"\" moment for a lot families who aren't informed. \n\nThe buses to the parks and Disney Springs are well laid out and easy to find. The bus schedules are posted throughout the front of the property so it was easy to plan what time you needed to be ready at the bus queue. It's also helpful that the app has the bus schedule as well to make planning easier. Pop Century has its own buses to and from the parks and doesn't make any stops like some of the All-Star resorts do, which is a nice bonus.

For appetizers we tried their tomato bisque and the brie plate. The tomato bisque was OK but not what I would typically expect from a bisque. The brie plate was WAY too sweet. It really needed something salty, savory, or spicy to balance out ALL the sweet things on the plate -- apples, strawberries, marmalade, honey. For the entree we got the sesame orange glazed salmon and the chicken saltimbocca. The salmon on its own was good, as was the broccolini that came with it, but the sauce was WAY too salty and the rice was under-seasoned. The chicken had a weird quality that made it look reheated which was not appealing. It lacked flavor and the sauce was not particularly great. The au gratin potatoes were a crowd favorite. For dessert we both got the apple crisp and it was truly the highlight of the meal. Absolutely perfect. \n\nRESTROOMS\nCute single stall restroom.

I've heard many great things about this place and its chicken and thought it'd be a great place to catch up with old friends.\n\nWe came in yesterday around 6:30p or so, about an hour after opening. It looked like a slow night and we were seated promptly. We were given water and silverware while we were waiting on another person. Things were looking good for this establishment so far.\nWhen the last member of our party arrived we were ready to order. One of my friends ordered 5 drumsticks. The waitress told us to hold on a second and hurried away. She came back to say they were out of drumsticks but had exactly 5 left for my friend. That was interesting... We continued ordering.\nOne of my friends ordered 5 chicken tenders with sauce on the side and no fries. Another friend ordered a pint of Bluemoon and some dumplings. My other friend ordered the kimchi fries with just regular cut fries.\nI wanted to order the drumsticks, but since they suddenly ran out, I tried to order the wings. The waitress told me they ran out of wings without checking, so I settled for the tenders and a side of waffle fries. I felt a little disappointed since I was eager to try their drumsticks, not the tenders.\nOur food came out and there were mix ups. I didn't get my side of fries and my other friend who ordered the tenders got the fries instead. My friend who ordered the kimchi fries with regular cut fries received waffle fries. It was probably just a simple mistake. We didn't call the waitress over and just made do. It wasn't too big of a deal.\nThe food was good. I tried my friend's drumstick and it was great. The chicken tenders paled in comparison. They were decent, but they weren't anything special like the drumstick. The fries were crispy and satisfying. My friends enjoyed their food. But this is where the dining experience went downhill.\nWe asked for 5 separate checks. The waitress said sure, but came back after a few minutes. She said they were only allowed to split checks 4 ways, but that she was willing to split it 5 ways. We thanked her for being kind enough to do that and she walked away. However, when she came back the checks were very messed up.\nMy friend was charged for the fries he never ordered, my bill only charged me only for the tenders and not the fries, but my friend who ordered the dumplings and pint of beer was charged with an entree of chicken tenders that she never ordered.\nThe latter of the charges was alarming, so we called the waitress over. After much explaining, she finally took the charge for the entree of chicken tenders off. We paid, tipped, and were on our way.\n\nOverall, the experience was not great. I didn't understand how they could be out of drumsticks and wings after being open for an hour or so. It didn't make sense. It was a slow night. There were two, maybe three, other groups. For a place that's open until 1-2am, you would think they'd have enough chicken.....\nThe mix up with the food wasn't great, but tolerable. Mistakes happen. My friends and I were okay with it, but it dampened the experience.\n\nThe food was good. The drumsticks and fries tasted great, but the tenders were just decent. My friends and I enjoyed the food we received.\n\nHowever, the check mix up was just awful. How did my friend get charged for an entree she never ordered? Those mystery chicken tenders never made it to the table, but they certainly found their way onto my friend's bill.\n\nIn short, the food was pretty okay but the experience certainly left much to be desired.

I'm already a fan of Raspberry White Chocolate ice-cream but that added flavour of rose just made it even better! It was a settle rose taste the lingers after your take a bite, not too over powering. \n\nLychee Osmanthus: 5/5 - Now this flavour I loved!!!! It had a fruity and floral vibe to it which went really well together. Sometimes I find lychee flavoured things too sweet but I think the osmanthus helped cut that a bit and balanced it out really well. It has a very light flavour, it was really good. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try. \n\nViet Coffee: 3/5 - I'm not a big fan of coffee flavoured stuff but this one wasn't bad. It wasn't too bitter or too sweet.

The service was horrible! The place was not busy at all when my group and I went in. The waitress told us to go sit down at a table instead of guiding us there which was great because we could sit where we wanted to sit. Never been here before so we were trying to figure out what to order and the waitress didn't give us any suggestions. When our orders were finally in, we got our food at very different times. I asked for fried dumplings and only the bottom portion was actually fried. I've been to other restaurants where they fry the whole thing so I was pretty thrown off by that, but that was okay. The waitress never came over to ask how everything was. Never refilled our water. Just put the food down wherever without making sure it was for the right person. So overall, we decided not to tip for a service where they literally put the food down and walked away. As we were leaving, the waitress comes after us saying \"\"no tip?\"\" and we respond \"\"no\"\". She didn't ask why or what she could do to improve and immediately went to get the manager. Now I don't know his name, but he was so rude. First it seemed like he was trying to understand why, but overall he was just trying to get us to pay a tip which the waitress did not deserve. Everything was explained to him and then he starts saying \"\"oh they shouldn't clean the tables or refill the water or take your orders\"\". This was just out right rude. Honestly I could have placed an order and picked it up from the kitchen myself and it would have been the same service. Then the manager comes outside after we finally leave and tried to continue to have the conversation with us. That's just out right harassment.

We had made reservations and got seated immediately which was nice. The restaurant wasn't all that busy- then again, it was a Tuesday night. We sat down and a few people ordered the $5 mule. The waitress said they had run out of strawberry and passion fruit, so one friend ordered lime, and the other ordered cucumber. The waitress brought back 2 lime drinks. She corrected it once she found out. I ordered a clam chowder soup (it's described as being very popular at this restaurant) and a quinoa and avocado Powerbowl. My friend ordered a steak well done. My other friends ordered various things. I expected my soup to get to me before my food did, but I sat there in 45 minutes to an hour of hungry misery, and all my friends started getting antsy for their own food. I was about to tell the waitress to forget about the soup when she finally brought all the food to us. She told me she'd get me a spoon and be right back, but as I ate my powerbowl, I realized she must have forgotten, because 15 minutes went by with no spoon. Well I wasn't going to let my soup go cold, so I drank it like the orphan in Oliver Twist. The soup itself was very delicious, and I can see why it's popular. To quote Oliver Twist, \"\"Please sir, I want some more.\"\"\nHowever, the avocado and quinoa powerbowl was a bit disappointing. The dressing was nowhere to be found when you first look at it- I finally saw it at the bottom of the dish in small clumps on one side of the plate. My friend's steak was definitely not well done (more like medium). When he sent it back to be cooked more, he had to wait so long we were all done with our meals. He asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said well done steaks take longer than less cooked steaks. Well yes, obviously, except we just expected the chef to cook that same steak more thoroughly. I guess they had to heat up a whole new steak???\nEither way, my friends argued that they wanted the steak comped for the inconvenience, and then pointed out my missing spoon. The waitress sheepishly apologized. I feel her pain- I used to be a waitress. I understand the frustrations of forgetting something simple or being blamed for the steak that the kitchen can't seem to cook well. Girl, I know how you feel. \nNevertheless, I wouldn't go back here except maybe to try the brunch.

The pulpo was cooked very tenderly which my boyfriend liked, but I like my octopus a little chewier. The chocolate for the churros could've been a little thicker. My boyfriend thought the churros could've been smaller in thicker because he thought it should be crispier. Overall, good food :). PS our total was ~80 without tip.\n\nBoyfriend's opinion: The date bacon was a good mix of sweet and salty, texture was different, but the date was a little strong. Tartare was good, fresh, yolk was a good touch. The duck was rich but a little oily. Potato bravas was good aioli was nice, good crispiness. Octopus had good texture, but sauce could've been better. And the churros were ok, choco sauce couldve been better. Beet salad was good, strong flavors, the cheese clashed with it a bit.

Four of us ate at Metropolis Café last night, and the meal was the second poorest I have had in fifty years.  Rarely do I write a poor restaurant review, but the meal last night was so bad, I felt I had write this. \n\nTwo of us had the meager cider-braised short rib, which was dry, stringy and tough.  The meat was served on a bed of a tepid, tasteless white puree, said to be potato - perhaps made from a box product.  The two were surrounded by a thin, tasteless brown liquid.  The puree was topped by two ostensibly roasted carrots.  One was partially cooked, raw in the center and the second could not have been in an oven for more than a few minutes.  Neither had been roasted with any meat juice, butter and anything that could provide flavor.  There was no seasoning to be tasted.\n\nMy wife had the squash and apple non-risotto \"\"risotto\"\".  The risotto was made with plain, white rice, seemingly cooked in water, not a vegetable broth, and served over a bland squash puree.  Mild chunks of apple were mixed in the rice.  Most uninteresting, and my wife left most of the dish uneaten.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the bread, possibly Iggy's, which we all ate as the meal mainstay.  One of us asked for butter, which was served as patties wrapped in foil.  \n\nThe cost of the meal was excessive.  The service was good, friendly, but not overly so.  The wait for the dishes was long, perhaps 20-30 minutes, especially so since none of the dishes was likely cooked to order.   It is difficult to believe this restaurant can survive for long.

There's barely any tables despite how large this place is. Most of it is empty space and during times where it is too crowded, this is largely inconvenient for customers.

So finally at 10:15pm we get seated as they were still arranging the tables when we were walking to our table where we had to stand for a few mins till they finish. We finally ordered and were told they were out of ribs which my husband wanted.. so we both ordered filet mignon, I ask the waiter twice please make sure that our steaks are well done he said no problem. So while waiting for our food we hear commotion and there was a fight that broke out at the bar with some women... another red flag I was definitely ready to go at this point, but hubby was like he wanted to stay cause he was so hungry so I agreed to stay. Our food finally came out at 11pm and it was still really red in the middle when i asked twice for well done so at this point I said enough.. we informed the waiter we didnt want it and just give us the bill for our drinks...the manager came over trying to plead with us but it was a no for me....

Problem #2 they have a \"\"vip\"\" area which people rent out but the only thing saying it's the vip area is a small sign which we completely missed as it it was our first time there so we enter since it looked pretty cool and we are immediately thrown out of the area with an EXTREMELY RUDE ATTITUDE.

This place is definitely for a younger crowd who doesn't mind cramped seating, bad parking options, and a loud atmosphere. Coming here with friends is a great time, coming here with your parents is not. Regardless of which location you pick you can expect to drive around searching for parking and waiting to be seated unless you go during the off times. When I came to the Clintonville location I found it particularly hard to find parking because of where it's located in the strip. I highly recommend walking or using ride share to get there so you don't have to worry about the parking situation. In addition, I wouldn't say Condado's is a great place if you're looking for something that's handicap accessible. It is pretty tricky to maneuver in the restaurant since there are so many people and tables are fairly close together, but I'm sure if you mention it they would try to seat you closer to the front! \n\nWith that being said Condado's is an awesome place to come for tacos, margs on the rocks, and plenty of chips and dip (not free, you do have to pay!)! When I come here I love to build my own tacos and always opt for the Sweet Lucy shell (flour tortilla, corn tortilla, queso and guac layered together) as a base for my creations. I'm a huge fan of the braised beef brisket as well as the pulled pork for the filling, but also enjoy some of their excellent vegetarian options such as the Thai chili tofu. To change things up pair the brisket with the pineapple salsa, queso fresco, and the chipotle honey sauce! Yum. If you're not feeling creative they've got you covered with a set menu of tacos you can order from. I will also say the tacos are fairly large. If you're ordering chips and dip I suggest only getting 2 tacos as you'll fill up quicker than expected. \n\nAll in all once you make it inside it's a nice relaxing joint to chill out with some friends and enjoy some delicious food.

It's been around a couple of years now, I think, but I'd never stopped to try it.  Went in and ordered a thin crust with the toppings we wanted, took it home and baked it and it was delicious.  Okay, so maybe if it had been cooked in a stone or wood fired oven, it would have been even better.  But, we were very pleased with the amount of toppings and the fresh taste.  Also tried the cheese bread which was also quite tasty.  The thin crust on the pizza is very thin, so if you're loading it up with toppings, you'll need to choose one of the sturdier crusts.  Will definitely visit again.</td><td>this place came as a bit of surprise its been around a couple of years now i think but id never stopped to try it went in and ordered a thin crust with the toppings we wanted took it home and baked it and it was delicious okay so maybe if it had been cooked in a stone or wood fired oven it would have been even better but we were very pleased with the amount of toppings and the fresh taste also tried the cheese bread which was also quite tasty the thin crust on the pizza is very thin so if you are loading it up with toppings you will need to choose one of the sturdier crusts will definitely visit again</td><td>place came bit surprise around couple year think identification never stopped try went ordered thin crust topping whatever wanted took home baked wa delicious okay maybe cooked stone wood fired oven would even better whatever pleased amount topping fresh taste also tried cheese bread wa also quite tasty thin crust pizza thin loading topping need choose one sturdier crust definitely visit</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>c5cf9MNOdJY33DOZz5Wtig</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-27</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"wow ! they have started a premier super club. last friday of the month. it was fantastic. white table clothes, paired custom cocktail for each course. marshal is the best bartender. so creative. the menu was great. 3 choices for each course. the place was slammed ! service was great no delays, food was delicious and hot! \nthe last friday in feb. 22 we are there with friends !!\"</td><td>wow they have started a premier super club last friday of the month it was fantastic white table clothes paired custom cocktail for each course marshal is the best bartender so creative the menu was great choices for each course the place was slammed service was great no delays food was delicious and hot the last friday in feb we are there with friends</td><td>wow started premier super club last friday month wa fantastic white table clothes paired custom cocktail course marshal best bartender creative menu wa great choice course place wa slammed service wa great delay food wa delicious hot last friday feb whatever friend</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>y0n1XazerJISK3bhspN-og</td><td>0</td><td>2019-03-01</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>4.0</td><td>First time.

I suspect it's amazing if you're eating all the cheesy and meaty stuff, but the other options are a hard BLECTHhhhtttthhhh. I'm NOT vegan, but I can't eat dairy and I'm trying to eat less meat. I wanted to try all the things and figured they'd make good leftovers, so I got the pate trio, the eggplant walnut-pate roll-up dealies, the smoked-bean stuffed-dough doohickey, the mushroom dumpling jobbers, and a side of the red pepper stuff (I don't recall the proper names of anything, sry). \n\nThe beet pate legit tasted moldy (don't ask me how I know what mold tastes like..?), the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on, and the spinach pate would've been good if it wasn't so salty. The eggplant walnut-pate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own.. it was basically just a mouthful of pate. The smoked-bean dough thing was SOooooooo effing salty.. and I'm not one to shy away from salt. I couldn't even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt, but it def could've used the extra flavor otherwise. The mushroom dumplings looked so good, and I LOVE all things mushroom (and dumpling!), but these were all mushroom and nothing else.. the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with. These just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a Friday night cuz they weren't invited to the onion and herb party at the Savory's.. They even got all dolled up in their dough dress and put on their best cracked pepper.. It was a pretty sad day in dumpling town..\n\nAll in all, my experience was pretty shMEHhhhh. I'd avoid this place if you're vegan or dairy-free. Im sure that puddle of cheesy eggy butter bread is orgasmic, and maybe the meat dishes are worth eating, but everything I ordered was really disappointing.. Although, the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty. Heavy on the fenugreek tho, which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it. The pita-like bread that came with the pate trio was good too, so if I eat there again (unlikely) I'll get the bread with a side of fenugreek-sweat surprise, and maybe I'll try the meat dumplings.. \n\nHopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they don't make any more super salty or moldy-tasting mistakes!\"</td><td>i really wanted to love this place i suspect its amazing if you are eating all the cheesy and meaty stuff but the other options are a hard blecthhhhtttthhhh I am not vegan but i cannot eat dairy and I am trying to eat less meat i wanted to try all the things and figured they would make good leftovers so i got the pate trio the eggplant walnutpate rollup dealies the smokedbean stuffeddough doohickey the mushroom dumpling jobbers and a side of the red pepper stuff i do not recall the proper names of anything sry the beet pate legit tasted moldy do not ask me how i know what mold tastes like the carrot version had a cardboard flavor going on and the spinach pate would have been good if it was not so salty the eggplant walnutpate dealies were pretty bitter and seemed too rich to be eaten on their own it was basically just a mouthful of pate the smokedbean dough thing was soooooooo effing salty and I am not one to shy away from salt i could not even put the red pepper stuff on it cuz it just added more salt but it def could have used the extra flavor otherwise the mushroom dumplings looked so good and i love all things mushroom and dumpling but these were all mushroom and nothing else the beauty of mushrooms is they take on the flavor of whatever else you cook them with these just tasted like lonely old mushrooms home alone on a friday night cuz they were not invited to the onion and herb party at the savorys they even got all dolled up in their dough dress and put on their best cracked pepper it was a pretty sad day in dumpling town all in all my experience was pretty shmehhhhh id avoid this place if you are vegan or dairyfree I am sure that puddle of cheesy eggy butter bread is orgasmic and maybe the meat dishes are worth eating but everything i ordered was really disappointing although the side of red pepper spread was pretty tasty heavy on the fenugreek tho which is one of those spices that you sweat out for days after you eat it the pitalike bread that came with the pate trio was good too so if i eat there again unlikely ill get the bread with a side of fenugreeksweat surprise and maybe ill try the meat dumplings hopefully these peeps start tasting their food more before they serve it so they do not make any more super salty or moldytasting mistakes</td><td>really wanted love place suspect amazing eating cheesy meaty stuff option hard blecthhhhtttthhhh I vegan eat dairy I trying eat le meat wanted try thing figured would make good leftover got pate trio eggplant walnutpate rollup dealies smokedbean stuffeddough doohickey mushroom dumpling jobber side red pepper stuff recall proper name anything sorry beet pate legit tasted moldy ask know mold taste like carrot version cardboard flavor going spinach pate would good wa salty eggplant walnutpate dealies pretty bitter seemed rich eaten wa basically mouthful pate smokedbean dough thing wa soooooooo effing salty I one shy away salt could even put red pepper stuff cause added salt definitely could used extra flavor otherwise mushroom dumpling looked good love thing mushroom dumpling mushroom nothing else beauty mushroom take flavor whatever else cook tasted like lonely old mushroom home alone friday night cause invited onion herb party savory even got dolled dough dress put best cracked pepper wa pretty sad day dumpling town experience wa pretty shmehhhhh identification avoid place vegan dairyfree I sure puddle cheesy eggy butter bread orgasmic maybe meat dish worth eating everything ordered wa really disappointing although side red pepper spread wa pretty tasty heavy fenugreek though one spice sweat day eat pitalike bread came pate trio wa good eat unlikely ill get bread side fenugreeksweat surprise maybe ill try meat dumpling hopefully people ( ) start tasting food serve make super salty moldytasting mistake</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>eY3-ZE8-njGOglACqFYqVQ</td><td>0</td><td>2019-01-11</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5.0</td><td>LaBottega is our family's favorite restaurant in Vancouver!

Unfortunately those days are long gone.  We did a pickup of 2 medium pizzas ($11 total), great low price, however still not worth it.  I think it is pretty sad that I would expect their buffet pizza to be better quality, not sure if any locations still do that.\n\nAs for the experience.  I ordered through the app, easy enough.  When i arrived I came inside to this store which is pretty small.  There was a couple dining inside, but as I approached the counter I didn't see a worker at all.  I continued to stand there for 5-10 minutes and I didn't hear a peep.  I could see cooked pizzas at the end of the conveyor belt, but no action otherwise.

The food here is delicious, there's great ambiance, and it's great for accommodating parties of all different sizes.\n\nMy friend and I came for dinner on a Thursday a little before 6 pm and it was surprisingly busy. We were able to get seated immediately though.\n\nThe restaurant has a great list of cocktails and alcoholic beverages (including happy hour!) which you don't find at most Indian restaurants. It's definitely a more upscale vibe.\n\nThe happy hour is a great deal. It runs Monday to Saturday 3-6 and 10 to close, as well as all day Sunday. There are daily drink specials (Thursday's was $2 off margaritas) as well small bites. I got the margarita as it was the special that day, and surprisingly it was pretty good. I'm picky with my margaritas and thought theirs was the best one I've had in a couple months. It wasn't too strong either.\n\nWe ordered a couple of apps to share and each ordered a curry.\n\nTandoori chicken (6 pieces for $16) was good. It comes with 3 chicken legs and 3 drumsticks. It's well flavored and moist. My friend didn't think it was spicy but I had a little trouble with it, since I'm extremely sensitive to spicy food.\n\nThe yellow daal fry ($12) was also really spicy. I couldn't eat more than a spoonful, which is unfortunate because it tasted delicious. We had asked them to make it mild so I'm guessing this is their version of mild...again my friend didn't think it was spicy but I really struggled with it.\n\nFor my main, I went with the fish curry ($16) and requested mild. Luckily this time it was actually mild. It was much sweeter than expected but not spicy at all, so I could actually eat it. They were generous with the fish chunks too. This was the first fish curry I've ever tried at an Indian restaurant but I'm very impressed.\n\nMy friend ordered the kadahi paneer ($14) and really enjoyed that too. We also ordered a couple of different breads (roti, paratha, and naan) along with a side of plain rice to eat with the curry.\n\nThe service was great. Our server was extremely attentive and even took away our empty plates and cups as we were finishing with them. We were in and out of here within an hour, which worked well with our schedule as we needed to catch a movie afterwards.\n\nThe meal cost ~$110 after tax and tip for the two of us, including one drink each and plenty of leftovers to take home!\"</td><td>one of the most popular indian restaurants in the whole vancouver greater area and for good reason the food here is delicious there is great ambiance and its great for accommodating parties of all different sizes my friend and i came for dinner on a thursday a little before pm and it was surprisingly busy we were able to get seated immediately though the restaurant has a great list of cocktails and alcoholic beverages including happy hour which you do not find at most indian restaurants its definitely a more upscale vibe the happy hour is a great deal it runs monday to saturday and to close as well as all day sunday there are daily drink specials thursdays was off margaritas as well small bites i got the margarita as it was the special that day and surprisingly it was pretty good I am picky with my margaritas and thought theirs was the best one I have had in a couple months it was not too strong either we ordered a couple of apps to share and each ordered a curry tandoori chicken pieces for was good it comes with chicken legs and drumsticks its well flavored and moist my friend did not think it was spicy but i had a little trouble with it since I am extremely sensitive to spicy food the yellow daal fry was also really spicy i could not eat more than a spoonful which is unfortunate because it tasted delicious we had asked them to make it mild so I am guessing this is their version of mildagain my friend did not think it was spicy but i really struggled with it for my main i went with the fish curry and requested mild luckily this time it was actually mild it was much sweeter than expected but not spicy at all so i could actually eat it they were generous with the fish chunks too this was the first fish curry I have ever tried at an indian restaurant but I am very impressed my friend ordered the kadahi paneer and really enjoyed that too we also ordered a couple of different breads roti paratha and naan along with a side of plain rice to eat with the curry the service was great our server was extremely attentive and even took away our empty plates and cups as we were finishing with them we were in and out of here within an hour which worked well with our schedule as we needed to catch a movie afterwards the meal cost after tax and tip for the two of us including one drink each and plenty of leftovers to take home</td><td>one popular indian restaurant whole vancouver greater area good reason food delicious great ambiance great accommodating party different size friend came dinner thursday little personal_message_/_private_message wa surprisingly busy whatever able get seated immediately though restaurant ha great list cocktail alcoholic beverage including happy hour find indian restaurant definitely upscale vibe happy hour great deal run monday saturday close well day sunday daily drink special thursday wa margarita well small bite got margarita wa special day surprisingly wa pretty good I picky margarita thought wa best one I couple month wa strong either whatever ordered couple apps share ordered curry tandoori chicken piece wa good come chicken leg drumstick well flavored moist friend think wa spicy little trouble since I extremely sensitive spicy food yellow daal fry wa also really spicy could eat spoonful unfortunate tasted delicious whatever asked make mild I guessing version mildagain friend think wa spicy really struggled main went fish curry requested mild luckily time wa actually mild wa much sweeter expected spicy could actually eat generous fish chunk wa first fish curry I ever tried author's_note indian restaurant I impressed friend ordered kadahi paneer really enjoyed whatever also ordered couple different bread roti paratha naan along side plain rice eat curry service wa great server wa extremely attentive even took away empty plate cup whatever finishing whatever within author's_note hour worked well schedule whatever needed catch movie afterwards meal cost tax tip two u including one drink plenty leftover take home</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>j0VWgf2QhoxpTLnODZxnnw</td><td>1</td><td>2019-03-04</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>4.0</td><td>So I stopped in for breakfast and had the French Toast, bacon and eggs scrambled w/ cheese.

It was basically vegetables and noodles rolled into a spongey-wrap (could almost equate it to an uthappam for anyone familiar with South Indian cuisine). I liked it, but it was pretty oily. This dish is definitely on the smaller side, more of an appetizer.\n\nThe vegetarian momos were pretty bland. Luckily, they had given us a few sauces and pickled vegetables which we were able to use to add a little more flavor. Would avoid getting these again. \n\nOther folks got the Sha Phaley (bread stuffed with beef), beef momos, and eggplant, which were all acceptable.\n\nWe also ordered one Tibetan tea, since some people had never tried it before. It came in a really adorable mug and was a lot less buttery than other Tibetan teas I have had, which I appreciated.\n\nOur waitress and servers were incredibly friendly.

I get especially excited for winter storms because I KNOW that nobody will dare ask me to go anywhere.\nWell, my friends and partner all wanted to go out for dinner as the first winter storm of 2019 was beginning. I really thought I could get out of it by telling them that I'm enjoying my weekend INDOORS. And by continuously telling them about the forecast. There was no winning with these extroverted people, so I ended up Orinoco.\nWell, I really had no regrets afterwards. I was actually HAPPY and GRATEFUL to them that we went out. There were very few people in the restaurant because of the snow, so we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves.\nPros: fun ambience and decor; GREAT food (I especially recommend the seared tuna, arepas, and empanadas)\nCon: the sangria tasted REALLY good, but it really doesn't feel like an alcoholic beverage. So, if you're looking to get buzzed... or tipsy... or drunk, the sangria won't do it for you. Thankfully, I don't like the taste of alcohol so the sangria served as just an awesome beverage that went well with my food.\nWill I return here? Absolutely.

Again, the food is amazing and our waiter was excellent. My husband and I first dined at Hollerbach's around 10 months ago. The weather was nice but cool enough for me to wear a sweater. Once we were seated I took off my grey wrap around sweater and place it on the seat next to me. Unfortunately we left without my sweater. I called the restaurant later that day and was told they did not have it. I was advised to call back in a    couple of days which I did. Again I was told they did not have it. I tried again a week later and was told the same thing. No sweater. We dined at Hollerbach's again 6 months later and of course I asked about my sweater only to be told they did not have it. So today we decided to make the 90 minute trip to Sanford and visit our favorite German restaurant and upon our arrival (approximately 2:00 PM) both our jaws hit the floor. The hostess who was stationed outside was WEARING MY SWEATER. I immediately told her I liked her sweater and asked her where she got it. She appeared to be shocked so I told her that I had the same sweater and that I had left it behind at this very restaurant. She responded by telling me she got it at Target. This sweater was purchased at Dillard's in Ocala, FL and was not a Target product. In addition to that, this young lady was swimming in this sweater which was a size 3X. I did ask our waiter about the lost and found policy being that he was fairly new, he was unsure. He did offer to get a manager, however, we declined since it's just going to be her word against mine. I don't know what angers me more....her lying to my face or being lied to by staff 10 months ago. Either way this incident has put a sour taste in my mouth and I don't care to be a patron of an establishment that has employees with such dicey personal morals.</td><td>today was my third visit to hollerbachs and i love the food and service however I am not so sure that well ever come back again the food is amazing and our waiter was excellent my husband and i first dined at hollerbachs around months ago the weather was nice but cool enough for me to wear a sweater once we were seated i took off my grey wrap around sweater and place it on the seat next to me unfortunately we left without my sweater i called the restaurant later that day and was told they did not have it i was advised to call back in a couple of days which i did again i was told they did not have it i tried again a week later and was told the same thing no sweater we dined at hollerbachs again months later and of course i asked about my sweater only to be told they did not have it so today we decided to make the minute trip to sanford and visit our favorite german restaurant and upon our arrival approximately pm both our jaws hit the floor the hostess who was stationed outside was wearing my sweater i immediately told her i liked her sweater and asked her where she got it she appeared to be shocked so i told her that i had the same sweater and that i had left it behind at this very restaurant she responded by telling me she got it at target this sweater was purchased at dillards in ocala fl and was not a target product in addition to that this young lady was swimming in this sweater which was a size x i did ask our waiter about the lost and found policy being that he was fairly new he was unsure he did offer to get a manager however we declined since its just going to be her word against mine i do not know what angers me moreher lying to my face or being lied to by staff months ago either way this incident has put a sour taste in my mouth and i do not care to be a patron of an establishment that has employees with such dicey personal morals</td><td>today wa third visit hollerbachs love food service however I sure well ever come back food amazing waiter wa excellent husband first dined hollerbachs around month ago weather wa nice cool enough wear sweater whatever seated took grey wrap around sweater place seat next unfortunately whatever left without sweater called restaurant later day wa told wa advised call back couple day wa told tried week later wa told thing sweater whatever dined hollerbachs month later course asked sweater told today whatever decided make minute trip sanford visit favorite german restaurant upon arrival approximately personal_message_/_private_message jaw hit floor hostess wa stationed outside wa wearing sweater immediately told liked sweater asked got appeared shocked told sweater left behind restaurant responded telling got target sweater wa purchased dillards ocala fl wa target product addition young lady wa swimming sweater wa size x ask waiter lost found policy wa fairly new wa unsure offer get manager however whatever declined since going word mine know anger moreher lying face lied staff month ago either way incident ha put sour taste mouth care patron author's_note establishment ha employee dicey personal moral</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ekH1kNKsEFS-yNhP5U433g</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-24</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>We ALL love it!

The vegan options are plentiful, with things like spring rolls, noodle bowls, sautéed vegetables (like I can EVER resist bok choy?!) I think my eyes teared a bit looking at the menu, I swear. This is pretty much my favorite food on the planet.\n\nIt was a Friday night and people eat out on Friday nights, especially at 5 star places. The nicest lady at the host stand took my name and promised to text when a table was ready. And pay attention, because this is something that put this place over the top in the list of Joi B's favorite restaurants in the US (yes, Meyers & Chang, you're on it): when our table was ready 45 minutes later, we were at a cute pub right across the street, not minding a thing. The text informed us that our counter seats were ready. When I'm not dining alone, the last place in the world I want to sit is at a counter. Hell, even if I had been eating alone, I would have done so begrudgingly (and only if really hungry). So, I texted back and asked if it was OK if we waited a little longer for a table. The response was nothing short of wonderful. \"\"Sure, we can do that! It should be another half hour...\"\" Wow! I'm so used to high demand places acting like they are doing you a huge favor to seat you where you want (or NOT seat you where you don't want). It's just been my experience lately and I suppose I may have a chip on my shoulder about it. But this was such a breath of fresh air and will make me a forever customer.\n\nThe restaurant is loud and bustling, but it's a celebratory atmosphere, with people who are in love with their food. Can't beat that. Soon we were right there with them, as plate after plate arrived: the scallion pancakes (crispy/salty delicious), the BEST bok choy I've ever had, the so very transcendental tofu stirfry with slippery noodles (texture fest! And an extremely pleasing flavor) and crispy spring rolls that I devoured so quickly, they were barely even there. What I loved about these is all that swiss chard complicating things and making them better. Loved. Loved. Loved. It all.\n\nAnd they have cocktails (next time I have to try the homemade pineapple vodka), two of which feature mezcal, so hello. And a very decent Cava by the glass. Did I mention celebratory?

I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, and probably not the best Austin has to offer, but it is really good. Had a beef rib, smoked sausage, Mac, and their peach cobbler. The rib was HUGE! I didn't even get to finish it all because it was just too much. But damn was it nice. I think it could've been a bit more tender and juicy, but for the portion size it was still damn good, especially with their sauces on the table which I thought were fantastic. The sausage was good but nothing too special about it. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and creamy which I like, and being from Georgia, im a sucker for a good peach cobbler and theirs didn't disappoint!\n\nDrinks: I should title this beer, because it's beer galore! I tried something different which I didn't end up liking - should've gone for something lighter, but all in a they've got an incredible selection.\n\nAmbience: Typical BBQ spot with a casual yet still clean and polished vibe.\n\nPrice: This is where I had to dock them a star. The food was great don't get me wrong, but I thought it was way too overpriced.\n\nAll in all this'll definitely be a spot I'll try again when I'm in town, but there's definitely better places around if you manage to get lucky and catch them before they run out.\n\nSN: ***This Is My 100th Yelp Review!

The garlic spread comes with shredded cheese, giving it a nice texture.\nSmoked herring schmear: reminds me of smoked salmon.  Good fish that wasn't overpowering.  Good one.\n\nKhachapuri: consists of Georgian cheese bread and local honey.  Not what I was expecting as it is trying to be savory but the honey throws it off.\n\nStuffed egg with sumac: creamy stuffing. Egg cooked well.\n\nMushroom piroshki: very tasty.  The outside resembles the texture of a pretzel bun.  The mushroom were well flavored and chopped small.\n\nTraditional blini: comes with steelhead caviar and sour cream.  The caviar provides a nice sea flavor that complements the sour cream and soft pancake.\n\nWalnut stuffed eggplant roll:  not for me.  The crunch of the walnut, the mint, sunflower sesame oil (didn't notice) and pomegranate seed with the slippery eggplant roll was ok for me\n\nTort po kievski:  hazelnut meringue, coffee buttercream & chocolate ganache.

The room was modern and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were numerous and soft, yet supportive. It was the perfect size for the two of us, but I could see how a family of four might struggle to find a spot for all of their luggage with the pull down bed open. The aesthetics were fantastic! Each section of the property really reflected the decade it was representing and was truly a lot of fun to walk through and look at. \n\nThe food court had plenty of options. Admittedly, we didn't eat there often, but the food options seemed very kid friendly as there was something for even the pickiest eaters. The prices were in-line with what you would expect from a Disney resort. The pizza slices were huge, as they're basically 1/4 of an entire pizza so the $9 price tag isn't the worst thing in the world. The one \"\"flaw\"\" would be that the free mugs you get for staying at the resort don't have any signs suggesting they are free with your stay. This seemed like a \"\"gotcha\"\" moment for a lot families who aren't informed. \n\nThe buses to the parks and Disney Springs are well laid out and easy to find. The bus schedules are posted throughout the front of the property so it was easy to plan what time you needed to be ready at the bus queue. It's also helpful that the app has the bus schedule as well to make planning easier. Pop Century has its own buses to and from the parks and doesn't make any stops like some of the All-Star resorts do, which is a nice bonus. Overall, I would definitely consider staying at Pop Century again as it was convenient and a great value for what we were looking for in a resort (a place to sleep, shower and get ready for the parks!)\"</td><td>for being classified as one of disneys value resorts pop century felt like it was a good bit above the rest the room was modern and very clean the bed was comfortable and the pillows were numerous and soft yet supportive it was the perfect size for the two of us but i could see how a family of four might struggle to find a spot for all of their luggage with the pull down bed open the aesthetics were fantastic each section of the property really reflected the decade it was representing and was truly a lot of fun to walk through and look at the food court had plenty of options admittedly we did not eat there often but the food options seemed very kid friendly as there was something for even the pickiest eaters the prices were inline with what you would expect from a disney resort the pizza slices were huge as they are basically of an entire pizza so the price tag is not the worst thing in the world the one flaw would be that the free mugs you get for staying at the resort do not have any signs suggesting they are free with your stay this seemed like a gotcha moment for a lot families who are not informed the buses to the parks and disney springs are well laid out and easy to find the bus schedules are posted throughout the front of the property so it was easy to plan what time you needed to be ready at the bus queue its also helpful that the app has the bus schedule as well to make planning easier pop century has its own buses to and from the parks and does not make any stops like some of the allstar resorts do which is a nice bonus overall i would definitely consider staying at pop century again as it was convenient and a great value for what we were looking for in a resort a place to sleep shower and get ready for the parks</td><td>classified one disney value resort pop century felt like wa good bit rest room wa modern clean bed wa comfortable pillow numerous soft yet supportive wa perfect size two u could see family four might struggle find spot luggage pull bed open aesthetic fantastic section property really reflected decade wa representing wa truly lot fun walk look food court plenty option admittedly whatever eat often food option seemed kid friendly wa something even pickiest eater price inline would expect disney resort pizza slice huge basically author's_note entire pizza price tag worst thing world one flaw would free mug get staying resort sign suggesting free stay seemed like gotcha moment lot family informed bus park disney spring well laid easy find bus schedule posted throughout front property wa easy plan time needed ready bus queue also helpful app ha bus schedule well make planning easier pop century ha bus park doe make stop like allstar resort nice bonus overall would definitely consider staying pop century wa convenient great value whatever looking resort place sleep shower get ready park</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>g9-5_jy4TurUXNi1xWpWRg</td><td>0</td><td>2019-03-06</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>1.0</td><td>Something seriously wrong with the burger, tasted like dirt - dirty grill or dirty equipment?

Not a lot of tables so I'm sure it can get pretty busy.

At the end the hostess cleared our dessert plates and our waitress again didn't approach us for about 15-20 minutes. In between the food seemed to come out very slowly with the exception of our entrees. \n\nFOOD / BEVERAGE\nThis was really where the meal fell short for us. For appetizers we tried their tomato bisque and the brie plate. The tomato bisque was OK but not what I would typically expect from a bisque. The brie plate was WAY too sweet. It really needed something salty, savory, or spicy to balance out ALL the sweet things on the plate -- apples, strawberries, marmalade, honey. For the entree we got the sesame orange glazed salmon and the chicken saltimbocca. The salmon on its own was good, as was the broccolini that came with it, but the sauce was WAY too salty and the rice was under-seasoned. The chicken had a weird quality that made it look reheated which was not appealing. It lacked flavor and the sauce was not particularly great. The au gratin potatoes were a crowd favorite. For dessert we both got the apple crisp and it was truly the highlight of the meal. Absolutely perfect. \n\nRESTROOMS\nCute single stall restroom.

I came in with high hopes of eating some delicious food based on the pictures but left hungry and unsatisfied as a result of poor table service. \nThe restaurant only does walk ins for parties smaller than a size of 8. We came in on a Friday evening and were seated right away by a lovely hostess( one star is for the hostess)\nThe best part of the menu is that it has several vegan/ vegetarian options which is great when outing with friends who only follow a vegan/vegetarian/ gluten free diet. \nThe main reason for our horrible experience was our server. Despite it not being too busy he would disappear for lengths of time. From seating to ordering it was about 45 mins. \nWe orders a round of appetizers(3 dishes) and entrees(3 dishes). Again, the wait from ordering to having a meal on the table was about an hour. BUT....we were only served our entrees! Our server looked confused when we inquired about the appetizer round and returned to let us know that he had forgotten to enter the order entirely!\nFor our main course we got burgers and butternut squash lasagna. I got the Cajun burger with sweet potato fries. It was good nothing to write home about(2nd star). The sweet potato fries were soggy. My friend who got the lasgna(a special) enjoyed her meal. The third person on our table also got a burger without a bun but the meal came with the bun!\nThrough our time there we noticed confused runners with regards to which food went to what table.

I grabbed the 'What the Cluck' which I think has a good balance of sweet and savory with just a little spice so I'd definitely recommend that. The truffle Mac & cheese is tasty, might be a little heavy for some but it's worth the up-charge. Sadly, that about ends the positives from this visit. They managed to have one table member's order come out wrong twice and service just wasn't good. The restaurant was, if I'm generous, maybe half full and I just can't figure out why we then watched another table that came in and ordered after ours (we were both 4 tops) have their drinks refilled twice before ours came out. The Bloody Sally/Mary I ordered took the entire meal to arrive (in fairness I ordered when the food was delivered) but at no point was there any acknowledgement by staff that our drinks had taken so long (11min wait for a Bloody in a basically empty restaurant). The Bloody was hopefully a fluke and it's normally good but it tasted like straight up shrimp cocktail sauce. I like a spicy or even unique take on a Bloody Mary but this isn't it - whatever their 'made from scratch' recipe is needs a rework.</td><td>food was good not much else i grabbed the what the cluck which i think has a good balance of sweet and savory with just a little spice so id definitely recommend that the truffle mac cheese is tasty might be a little heavy for some but its worth the upcharge sadly that about ends the positives from this visit they managed to have one table members order come out wrong twice and service just was not good the restaurant was if I am generous maybe half full and i just cannot figure out why we then watched another table that came in and ordered after ours we were both tops have their drinks refilled twice before ours came out the bloody sallymary i ordered took the entire meal to arrive in fairness i ordered when the food was delivered but at no point was there any acknowledgement by staff that our drinks had taken so long min wait for a bloody in a basically empty restaurant the bloody was hopefully a fluke and its normally good but it tasted like straight up shrimp cocktail sauce i like a spicy or even unique take on a bloody mary but this is not it whatever their made from scratch recipe is needs a rework</td><td>food wa good much else grabbed cluck think ha good balance sweet savory little spice identification definitely recommend truffle mac cheese tasty might little heavy worth upcharge sadly end positive visit managed one table member order come wrong twice service wa good restaurant wa I generous maybe half full figure whatever watched another table came ordered whatever top drink refilled twice came bloody sallymary ordered took entire meal arrive fairness ordered food wa delivered point wa acknowledgement staff drink taken long minute wait bloody basically empty restaurant bloody wa hopefully fluke normally good tasted like straight shrimp cocktail sauce like spicy even unique take bloody mary whatever made scratch recipe need rework</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>XqNgfxyXP3kz8t3iG8ehZA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-18</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"This is my new favorite vegan spot.

I've heard many great things about this place and its chicken and thought it'd be a great place to catch up with old friends.\n\nWe came in yesterday around 6:30p or so, about an hour after opening. It looked like a slow night and we were seated promptly. We were given water and silverware while we were waiting on another person. Things were looking good for this establishment so far.\nWhen the last member of our party arrived we were ready to order. One of my friends ordered 5 drumsticks. The waitress told us to hold on a second and hurried away. She came back to say they were out of drumsticks but had exactly 5 left for my friend. That was interesting... We continued ordering.\nOne of my friends ordered 5 chicken tenders with sauce on the side and no fries. Another friend ordered a pint of Bluemoon and some dumplings. My other friend ordered the kimchi fries with just regular cut fries.\nI wanted to order the drumsticks, but since they suddenly ran out, I tried to order the wings. The waitress told me they ran out of wings without checking, so I settled for the tenders and a side of waffle fries. I felt a little disappointed since I was eager to try their drumsticks, not the tenders.\nOur food came out and there were mix ups. I didn't get my side of fries and my other friend who ordered the tenders got the fries instead. My friend who ordered the kimchi fries with regular cut fries received waffle fries. It was probably just a simple mistake. We didn't call the waitress over and just made do. It wasn't too big of a deal.\nThe food was good. I tried my friend's drumstick and it was great. The chicken tenders paled in comparison. They were decent, but they weren't anything special like the drumstick. The fries were crispy and satisfying. My friends enjoyed their food. But this is where the dining experience went downhill.\nWe asked for 5 separate checks. The waitress said sure, but came back after a few minutes. She said they were only allowed to split checks 4 ways, but that she was willing to split it 5 ways. We thanked her for being kind enough to do that and she walked away. However, when she came back the checks were very messed up.\nMy friend was charged for the fries he never ordered, my bill only charged me only for the tenders and not the fries, but my friend who ordered the dumplings and pint of beer was charged with an entree of chicken tenders that she never ordered.\nThe latter of the charges was alarming, so we called the waitress over. After much explaining, she finally took the charge for the entree of chicken tenders off. We paid, tipped, and were on our way.\n\nOverall, the experience was not great. I didn't understand how they could be out of drumsticks and wings after being open for an hour or so. It didn't make sense. It was a slow night. There were two, maybe three, other groups. For a place that's open until 1-2am, you would think they'd have enough chicken.....\nThe mix up with the food wasn't great, but tolerable. Mistakes happen. My friends and I were okay with it, but it dampened the experience.\n\nThe food was good. The drumsticks and fries tasted great, but the tenders were just decent. My friends and I enjoyed the food we received.\n\nHowever, the check mix up was just awful. How did my friend get charged for an entree she never ordered? Those mystery chicken tenders never made it to the table, but they certainly found their way onto my friend's bill.\n\nIn short, the food was pretty okay but the experience certainly left much to be desired. I'm not sure if the quality of food is worth the poor service.

I did not try the pork ribs.\nAs others said, the brisket is salty so grab some complimentary white bread by the utensils area, which also offers free pickle slices and limes. Get a Jalapeño pepper or 2 for 35 cents each. \n\nSides: Cole slaw was ok. Cornbread is excellent. Huge muffins that are soft and not too dry. \n\nDessert: Banana Pudding has a few chunks of banana. It was ok.\n\nOverall, it's a very fun place to grab dinner. Go with a group, grab some beer or wine from the iced station while you're in line with your tray. Everyone's incredibly friendly. Nice to have unlimited white bread and pickles.\n\nYou can get smaller portions so instead of ordering a whole pound of sausage you can just order a link.\n\nCall them to get expected line-wait time and what meat is still available. \n\n4.5 stars so I'll round up to 5.\"</td><td>my review is based on service and food i cannot measure the value against how long you would wait in line as i went on a wednesday evening with a short line if i were to guess though its worth going if the wait is under an hour its good to have a top bbq spot in austin open for dinner though it may not be on the level of franklins or la barbecue terry blacks barbecue is a premiere bbq experience especially for a large place open for dinner meats really like the brisket and jalapeño cheese sausage beef ribs were a little dry despite having too much hardened fat layers i did not try the pork ribs as others said the brisket is salty so grab some complimentary white bread by the utensils area which also offers free pickle slices and limes get a jalapeño pepper or for cents each sides cole slaw was ok cornbread is excellent huge muffins that are soft and not too dry dessert banana pudding has a few chunks of banana it was ok overall its a very fun place to grab dinner go with a group grab some beer or wine from the iced station while you are in line with your tray everyone is incredibly friendly nice to have unlimited white bread and pickles you can get smaller portions so instead of ordering a whole pound of sausage you can just order a link call them to get expected linewait time and what meat is still available stars so ill round up to</td><td>review based service food measure value long would wait line went wednesday evening short line guess though worth going wait author's_note hour good top barbeque spot austin open dinner though may level franklin laughing_alot barbecue terry black barbecue premiere barbeque experience especially large place open dinner meat really like brisket jalapeño cheese sausage beef rib little dry despite much hardened fat layer try pork rib others said brisket salty grab complimentary white bread utensil area also offer free pickle slice lime get jalapeño pepper cent side cole slaw wa ok cornbread excellent huge muffin soft dry dessert banana pudding ha chunk banana wa ok overall fun place grab dinner go group grab beer wine iced station line tray everyone incredibly friendly nice unlimited white bread pickle get smaller portion instead ordering whole pound sausage order link call get expected linewait time meat still available star ill round</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>_0jwczJo5LaSo8e6liyS4Q</td><td>3</td><td>2019-01-14</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3.0</td><td>Coffee shop within the Atlanta History Center.

They had some really interesting flavours that most other ice-cream cafes don't have. I love how they offer ice-cream flights; 4 scoops for $12. That's what really intrigued me to come here, since I always have the hardest time choosing a flavour. The 4 flavours I chose were: HK Milk Tea, Raspberry White Chocolate Rose, Lychee Osmanthus and Viet Coffee.\n\nHK Milk Tea: 2/5 - I was really excited to try this flavour only to be disappointed. Probably because I'm used to more sweet milk teas, this had more of a tea taste. \n\nRaspberry White Chocolate Rose: 4/5 - I really enjoyed this flavour. I'm already a fan of Raspberry White Chocolate ice-cream but that added flavour of rose just made it even better! It was a settle rose taste the lingers after your take a bite, not too over powering. \n\nLychee Osmanthus: 5/5 - Now this flavour I loved!!!! It had a fruity and floral vibe to it which went really well together. Sometimes I find lychee flavoured things too sweet but I think the osmanthus helped cut that a bit and balanced it out really well. It has a very light flavour, it was really good.

The pernil sandwich was pretty good. Yuca fries had a great cilantro garlic sauce however it may have been a little too much. Maybe offer to have it on the side, some of the yuca were so drenched that the middle became soggy. Croquettas were ok, nothing to write home about. Cafe con leche was good, maybe a little too much milk for my liking. OJ was average, nothing special. Overall experience was average. I ended up getting my food before I got my drinks which was weird. I would have thought drinks would come first or at least offer water for your guests. A couple sitting next to me ate their whole meal before they were able to get anyone to bring them water. The overall service could have been better.

We arrived and parked in their parking lot (looked like they have valet but it wasn't operating on a late night weekday) and waited a short bit in the bar area for our table. Venue is hip, loud, and modern and at least when we were there it seemed like mainly locals were around us.\nWhile it looked like most tables were ordering rolls we opted for mainly various special sashimi (6 pieces, which seemed like a much better deal than sushi, which was 2 pieces).

I asked for fried dumplings and only the bottom portion was actually fried. I've been to other restaurants where they fry the whole thing so I was pretty thrown off by that, but that was okay. The waitress never came over to ask how everything was. Never refilled our water. Just put the food down wherever without making sure it was for the right person. So overall, we decided not to tip for a service where they literally put the food down and walked away. As we were leaving, the waitress comes after us saying \"\"no tip?\"\" and we respond \"\"no\"\". She didn't ask why or what she could do to improve and immediately went to get the manager. Now I don't know his name, but he was so rude. First it seemed like he was trying to understand why, but overall he was just trying to get us to pay a tip which the waitress did not deserve. Everything was explained to him and then he starts saying \"\"oh they shouldn't clean the tables or refill the water or take your orders\"\". This was just out right rude. Honestly I could have placed an order and picked it up from the kitchen myself and it would have been the same service. Then the manager comes outside after we finally leave and tried to continue to have the conversation with us. That's just out right harassment.

We had made reservations and got seated immediately which was nice. The restaurant wasn't all that busy- then again, it was a Tuesday night. We sat down and a few people ordered the $5 mule. The waitress said they had run out of strawberry and passion fruit, so one friend ordered lime, and the other ordered cucumber. The waitress brought back 2 lime drinks. She corrected it once she found out. I ordered a clam chowder soup (it's described as being very popular at this restaurant) and a quinoa and avocado Powerbowl. My friend ordered a steak well done. My other friends ordered various things. I expected my soup to get to me before my food did, but I sat there in 45 minutes to an hour of hungry misery, and all my friends started getting antsy for their own food. I was about to tell the waitress to forget about the soup when she finally brought all the food to us. She told me she'd get me a spoon and be right back, but as I ate my powerbowl, I realized she must have forgotten, because 15 minutes went by with no spoon. Well I wasn't going to let my soup go cold, so I drank it like the orphan in Oliver Twist. The soup itself was very delicious, and I can see why it's popular. To quote Oliver Twist, \"\"Please sir, I want some more.\"\"\nHowever, the avocado and quinoa powerbowl was a bit disappointing. The dressing was nowhere to be found when you first look at it- I finally saw it at the bottom of the dish in small clumps on one side of the plate. My friend's steak was definitely not well done (more like medium). When he sent it back to be cooked more, he had to wait so long we were all done with our meals. He asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said well done steaks take longer than less cooked steaks. Well yes, obviously, except we just expected the chef to cook that same steak more thoroughly. I guess they had to heat up a whole new steak???\nEither way, my friends argued that they wanted the steak comped for the inconvenience, and then pointed out my missing spoon. The waitress sheepishly apologized. I feel her pain- I used to be a waitress. I understand the frustrations of forgetting something simple or being blamed for the steak that the kitchen can't seem to cook well. Girl, I know how you feel. \nNevertheless, I wouldn't go back here except maybe to try the brunch. Food took too long, meal was subpar...the only thing good was my cup of clam chowder.\"</td><td>i went to this restaurant for the first time with a group of friends we had made reservations and got seated immediately which was nice the restaurant was not all that busy then again it was a tuesday night we sat down and a few people ordered the mule the waitress said they had run out of strawberry and passion fruit so one friend ordered lime and the other ordered cucumber the waitress brought back lime drinks she corrected it once she found out i ordered a clam chowder soup its described as being very popular at this restaurant and a quinoa and avocado powerbowl my friend ordered a steak well done my other friends ordered various things i expected my soup to get to me before my food did but i sat there in minutes to an hour of hungry misery and all my friends started getting antsy for their own food i was about to tell the waitress to forget about the soup when she finally brought all the food to us she told me she would get me a spoon and be right back but as i ate my powerbowl i realized she must have forgotten because minutes went by with no spoon well i was not going to let my soup go cold so i drank it like the orphan in oliver twist the soup itself was very delicious and i can see why its popular to quote oliver twist please sir i want some more however the avocado and quinoa powerbowl was a bit disappointing the dressing was nowhere to be found when you first look at it i finally saw it at the bottom of the dish in small clumps on one side of the plate my friends steak was definitely not well done more like medium when he sent it back to be cooked more he had to wait so long we were all done with our meals he asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said well done steaks take longer than less cooked steaks well yes obviously except we just expected the chef to cook that same steak more thoroughly i guess they had to heat up a whole new steak either way my friends argued that they wanted the steak comped for the inconvenience and then pointed out my missing spoon the waitress sheepishly apologized i feel her pain i used to be a waitress i understand the frustrations of forgetting something simple or being blamed for the steak that the kitchen cannot seem to cook well girl i know how you feel nevertheless i would not go back here except maybe to try the brunch food took too long meal was subparthe only thing good was my cup of clam chowder</td><td>went restaurant first time group friend whatever made reservation got seated immediately wa nice restaurant wa busy wa tuesday night whatever sorry_about_that people ordered mule waitress said run strawberry passion fruit one friend ordered lime ordered cucumber waitress brought back lime drink corrected found ordered clam chowder soup described popular restaurant quinoa avocado powerbowl friend ordered steak well done friend ordered various thing expected soup get food sorry_about_that minute author's_note hour hungry misery friend started getting antsy food wa tell waitress forget soup finally brought food u told would get spoon right back ate powerbowl realized must forgotten minute went spoon well wa going let soup go cold drank like orphan oliver twist soup wa delicious see popular quote oliver twist please sir want however avocado quinoa powerbowl wa bit disappointing dressing wa nowhere found first look finally saw bottom dish small clump one side plate friend steak wa definitely well done like medium sent back cooked wait long whatever done meal asked waitress wa taking long said well done steak take longer le cooked steak well yes obviously except whatever expected chef cook steak thoroughly guess heat whole new steak either way friend argued wanted steak comped inconvenience pointed missing spoon waitress sheepishly apologized feel pain used waitress understand frustration forgetting something simple blamed steak kitchen seem cook well girl know feel nevertheless would go back except maybe try brunch food took long meal wa subparthe thing good wa cup clam chowder</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>nqKL5PbJbwwoCK_Xon31kA</td><td>0</td><td>2019-02-16</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>4.0</td><td>Made our reservation online with no problem.

I wanted to find a place close to my kids daycare. So happy to have found this place. Plenty of parking in the lot and once you walk in pass the front door you really feel like you were is NAPA, CA. The decors have that rustic country feel. What I wore to eat yesterday coordinate with the theme of the restaurant so well. We came exactly at 3 so it wasn't that busy yet which meant I got to get good photos of the restaurant. So happy hour is from 3-7pm and only in the bar area. The bar area has plenty of seatings and tables. There which wasn't a huge selection for happy hour food and drinks wise but what they had on the menu was so good. I didn't not get the 5 dollar happy hour wine instead I got the mascoto d'asti for 9 dollars and let me tell you if you love very sweet wine you have to get this one.
